# Apis and Microservices

Click any of the links below to view my notes and answers I came up with while going through the *Apis and Microservices* challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp.

As there is no real other place to put this in my freeCodeCamp repository since the beta freeCodeCamp curriculum has been officially released... I have some older notes for *JSON APIs and Ajax* that can be viewed:

- [Old JSON APIs and Ajax Notes](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/5.%20Apis%20and%20Microservices/Legacy%20Apis%20and%20Microservices%20Files%20%26%20Notes/json-apis-and-ajax#json-apis-and-ajax)
- [Even older JSON APIs and Ajax Notes](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/5.%20Apis%20and%20Microservices/Legacy%20Apis%20and%20Microservices%20Files%20%26%20Notes/json-apis-and-ajax/lesson-notes.txt#L1)

These notes were part of the first few sections of the Front End Development section on the legacy freeCodeCamp curriculum (now Responsive Web Design). This was a small series of lessons in which taught the very basics of retrieving data from APIs and update HTML using what was retrieved with Ajax.

I'm not sure if much of it is relevant to me anymore, but it was the first few steps I took in learning about how to use APIs and working with JSON.

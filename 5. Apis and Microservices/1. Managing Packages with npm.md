## Introduction to the Managing Packages with npm Challenges

I learned much of what I know about npm by creating two different boilerplates: my [Static Site Boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/static-site-boilerplate) and my [React-Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate).

I created the *static site boilerplate* while learning webpack, which I took upon myself after finishing my first paid freelance project. I wanted to make something that I could potentially use for future static websites, but have yet to find another use for this boilerplate. I am very happy I went through with making this boilerplate though, because I learned quite a lot about not only webpack but npm as well.

The *React-Redux boilerplate* I created has been through many changes as I progress further through the *front end libraries* projects, as I am changing it as I progress and learn more about webpack. Stephen Grider's **Modern React with Redux** course on *Udemy* helped initially get me going on learning both React and Redux which also gave me the idea to make my own boilerplate rather than relying on the popular create-react-app. Both of my boilerplates use npm in order to manage all the assets each boilerplate needs to function.

As there is no real other place to put this in my freeCodeCamp repository since the beta freeCodeCamp curriculum has been officially released... I have some older notes for *JSON APIs and Ajax* that can be viewed:

- [Old JSON APIs and Ajax Notes](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/5.%20Apis%20and%20Microservices/Legacy%20Apis%20and%20Microservices%20Files%20%26%20Notes/json-apis-and-ajax#json-apis-and-ajax)
- [Even older JSON APIs and Ajax Notes](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/5.%20Apis%20and%20Microservices/Legacy%20Apis%20and%20Microservices%20Files%20%26%20Notes/json-apis-and-ajax/lesson-notes.txt#L1)

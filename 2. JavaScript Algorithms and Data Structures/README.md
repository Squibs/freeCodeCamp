# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Click any of the links below to view my notes and answers I came up with while going through the *JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures* challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp.

Check out my [JavaScript References](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20References.md#javascript-references) I have thrown together from various sources such as [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (W3S). I tried to take the best from both sites and combine them into a single page of JavaScript references.

I also have some legacy files and notes related to this section; in which I wanted to keep to be able to look back on:

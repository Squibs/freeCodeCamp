## Palindrome Checker

```JavaScript
// CONDENSED VERSION - NO CONSOLE OUTPUTS

  function palindrome(str) {
    return str.toLowerCase().replace(/[\W_]/g, '').split('')
      .every((value, index, array) => value === array[array.length - 1 - index]);
  }
```

[(check-for-palindromes.js)](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects/Palindrome%20Checker/check-for-palindromes.js#L1)

To test whether or not the passed string is a palindrome, I start by converting the string to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. I then use the `replace()` method to remove all non-word characters (`\W`) as well as any underscores (`_`). I then split the string up into an array using `split()`. To iterate through this new array I use the `every()` method and compare each value to the opposite end; if the characters match up throughout then it is a palindrome and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.

## Roman Numeral Converter

```JavaScript
// CONDENSED VERSION - NO CONSOLE OUTPUTS

  function convertToRoman(num) {
    const romanValue = [1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 400, 500, 900, 1000];
    const romanSymbol = ['I', 'IV', 'V', 'IX', 'X', 'XL', 'L', 'XC', 'C', 'CD', 'D', 'CM', 'M'];
    let passedNum = num;
    let converted = '';

    for (let i = romanValue.length; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
      while (romanValue[i] <= passedNum) {
        converted += romanSymbol[i];
        passedNum -= romanValue[i];
      }
    }

    return converted;
  }
```

[(roman-num-converter.js)](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects/Roman%20Numeral%20Convert/roman-num-converter.js#L1)

To convert a number to its roman numeral counterpart, I first create two different arrays. I create a `romanValue` array which holds the numeric values for each of the roman symbols in the `romanSymbol` array. I could probably accomplish the same using an `Object`. I then create two more variables one to hold the value of the passed number, as to not modify the original passed string, `passedNum`. And the other variable `converted` which will hold the romanized version of the passed number, that will be returned.

I use two loops, a `for` loop, and a nested `while` loop inside the for loop. These two loops are what will help in the creation of the romanized number. The `for` loop goes from the highest number in the `romanValue` array to the lowest. The `while` loop pushes the roman symbols to `converted`, based on the current index/value of the `for` loop. When a roman symbol is pushed to the `converted` string the value is subtracted from `passedNum`.

## Caesars Cipher

```JavaScript
console.log('Objective: Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.\n');

function rot13(str) {
// CONDENSED VERSION - NO CONSOLE OUTPUTS

  function rot13(str) {
    return str.replace(/[A-Z]/g, letter => String.fromCharCode((letter.charCodeAt(0) % 26) + 65));
  }
```

[(caesars-cipher.js)](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects/Caesars%20Cipher/caesars-cipher.js#L1)

The cipher for this solution is simply to adjust the current character by `13` places. To solve this challenge you have to work with the `character codes` for any given character.

I start by using the `replace()` method on the passed string, which aims at replacing any uppercase letter `A` through `Z`. To find what the letter is going to be replaced with I find the character code for the current letter using the `charCodeAt()` method. I then use the modulus/remainder (`%`) operator and find the remainder of this character code divided by `26` (the total letters of the alphabet). I then add `65` to this remainder as the uppercase character codes start at `65` which is the uppercase letter `A`. This is what finds which letter to replace the current character.

## Telephone Number Validator

```JavaScript
// CONDENSED VERSION - NO CONSOLE OUTPUTS

function telephoneCheck(str) {
  return /^1?\s?(\s?\(\d{3}\)\s?|\d{3}-?\s?)\d{3}\s?-?\d{4}$/g.test(str);
}
```

[(validate-telephone.js)](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects/Telephone%20Number%20Validator/validate-telephone.js#L1)

This is a great challenge to do to help understand `Regular Expressions` more.

Breaking down my regular expression string `^1?\s?(\s?\(\d{3}\)\s?|\d{3}-?\s?)\d{3}\s?-?\d{4}$` :

`^1?\s?` :

|||
|---|---|
|`^1?`|   - Number starts with zero or one of `1`.|
|`\s?`|   - Checks for any whitespace character zero or one time.|

`(\s?\(\d{3}\)\s?|\dO{3}-?\s?)` :

|||
|---|---|
|`()`|    - Parentheses represent a capturing group (surrounding the whole expression).|
|`\s?`|   - Checks for any whitespace character zero or one time.|
|`\(`|    - A literal check for the symbol/character `(`.|
|`\d{3}`| - Searches for exactly `3` occurrences of any digit `\d`.|
|`\)`|    - A literal check for the symbol/character `)`.|
|`\s?`|   - Checks for any whitespace character zero or one time.|
|`|`|     - Match either regular expression on either side of this bar `|` (OR).|
|`\d{3}`| - Searches for exactly `3` occurrences of any digit `\d`.|
|`-?`|    - Searches for zero or one hyphen (`-`).|
|`\s?`|   - Checks for any whitespace character zero or one time.|

`\d{3}\s?-?\d{4}$`

|||
|---|---|
|`\d{3}`| - Searches for exactly `3` occurrences of any digit `\d`|
|`\s?`|   - Checks for any whitespace character zero or one time.|
|`-?`|    - Searches for zero or one hyphen (`-`).|
|`\d{4}$`| - Searches for exactly `4` occurrences of any digit `\d`, that is ending/at the end of a string.|

## Cash Register

```JavaScript
// CONDENSED VERSION - NO CONSOLE OUTPUTS

  function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
    const change = [];

    let owe = (cash - price).toFixed(2);
    let worth = ['ONE HUNDRED', 'TWENTY', 'TEN', 'FIVE', 'ONE', 'QUARTER', 'DIME', 'NICKEL', 'PENNY'];

    const cashRegister = {
      PENNY: { value: 0.01, amount: 0 },
      NICKEL: { value: 0.05, amount: 0 },
      DIME: { value: 0.10, amount: 0 },
      QUARTER: { value: 0.25, amount: 0 },
      ONE: { value: 1.00, amount: 0 },
      FIVE: { value: 5.00, amount: 0 },
      TEN: { value: 10.00, amount: 0 },
      TWENTY: { value: 20.00, amount: 0 },
      'ONE HUNDRED': { value: 100.00, amount: 0 },
    };

    cid.forEach((e) => {
      const currency = cashRegister[e[0]];
      currency.amount = Math.ceil(e[1] / currency.value);
    });

    worth = worth.filter((e) => {
      const currency = cashRegister[e];

      if (currency.value <= owe && currency.amount !== 0) {
        let amount = 0;

        while (currency.value <= owe && currency.amount !== 0) {
          amount += 1;
          currency.amount -= 1;
          owe = Number(owe).toFixed(2) - (currency.value).toFixed(2);
        }

        change.push([e, parseFloat((amount * currency.value).toFixed(2))]);
      }

      if (currency.amount === 0) return false;

      return true;
    });

    if (owe === 0 && worth.length === 0) { return { status: 'CLOSED', change: cid }; }

    if (owe > 0) { return { status: 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS', change: [] }; }

    return { status: 'OPEN', change };
  }
```

[(exact-change.js)](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects/Cash%20Register/exact-change.js#L1)

For this challenge I wanted to work with an object, because there have not been too many challenges where they were used; and every challenge has been using arrays and their methods.

The passed cash register *inventory* or the amount of denominations the cash register has, was in a two dimensional array. Converting this array to values in my `cashRegister` object is where I learned about some *experimental features* dealing with objects in JavaScript. I learned about `Object.entries()` and `Object.values()`. These two methods allow for iterating through objects without having to use a for loop such as `for (var key in obj)` or `for (const key of Object.keys(obj))`. Instead you would be able to do:

```JavaScript
Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log('do things other than a console log')
});
```

Or use `Object.values` similarly; or even combine the two in some way.

I avoided using these for now. Instead I opted for using what I already knew in conjunction with my `cashRegister` object. My object stores each denomination/currency, their value, and the amount of each denomination passed to the function.

After storing any denomination related information, I use the `filter()` method to go through a `worth` array I created which is holding the denomination names in order from highest value to lowest value. I had to create this array, because I opted to not use experimental object methods. Iterating through this array I check if the currency value is equal to or less than that of what is owed and if the currency amount is not 0. 

If the checks pass I have a while loop that counts the amount of a currency that will be given to the customer, subtracts one of the currency from the cash register and updates the amount still owed to the customer. This loop is controlled by if the currency value is less than or equal to the amount owed and if the currency amount is not 0.

Once that loop finishes the change type and amount is pushed to the change variable in an array. And finally if the currency amount is equal to 0, return false to remove it from the worth array. Otherwise return true to leave it in the array.

Finally I have two final checks after that ordeal. If the amount still owed to the customer is equal to 0 and the worth array length is 0, meaning there is nothing left in the register, return 'closed'. If the amount owed is greater than 0 return 'insufficient funds'. Finally, after all that return the change array.

Explanation over.

A greater challenge for this challenge would to include the [test-case from this freeCodeCamp article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/exact-solution-for-exact-change-81e1d23bfe58). The test case being:

```JavaScript
// should return {status: "OPEN", change: [['DIME', 0.30]]}
checkCashRegister(19.7, 20, [['PENNY', 0], ['NICKEL', 0], ['DIME', 1], ['QUARTER', 2.5], ['ONE', 0], ['FIVE', 0], ['TEN', 0], ['TWENTY', 0], ['ONE HUNDRED', 0]]);
```

The challenge here is that there is that there is only DIMES and QUARTERS to return as change; and the required amount of change is `$0.30`. So in most cases when someone is trying to complete this challenge they would go in order from largest to smallest denominations. So you would return `.25`, a quarter, and then move down to the dimes, which would go over the change to return, so then it would move down to nickels, which there are none.

This would result in having insufficient funds, but there really is sufficient funds. The article linked above goes over how this issue could be solved, but it is outside the scope of this challenge.

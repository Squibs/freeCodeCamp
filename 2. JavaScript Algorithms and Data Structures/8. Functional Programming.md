## Learn About Functional Programming

```JavaScript
/**
 * A long process to prepare tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of tea.
 **/
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];
  
  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

// Add your code below this line

const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40); // :(

// Add your code above this line

console.log(tea4TeamFCC);
```

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated function, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

`INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change.

2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output.

3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled.

## Understand Functional Programming Terminology

```JavaScript
/**
 * A long process to prepare green tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of green tea.
 **/
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * A long process to prepare black tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of black tea.
 **/
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {function():string} prepareTea The type of tea preparing function.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

// Add your code below this line

const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27); // :(
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13); // :(

// Add your code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
```

`Callbacks` are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in `filter`, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called `first class` functions. In JavaScript, all functions are `first class` functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called `higher order` functions.

When functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a `lambda`.

## Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

```JavaScript
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function (tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // we keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function (otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function (tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function (index) {
  const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.splice(0, index); // get the tabs before the tab
  const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.splice(index); // get the tabs after the tab

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // join them together
  return this;
};

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); //  Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
                    .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
                    .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
                    .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());

console.log(finalTabs.tabs);
```

The `splice` method is the problem (in the `tabClose` function). `Splice` modifies the original array it is called on, so the second splice call is working with a modified array, which gives the unexpected results.

There are two types of programming: `imperative` and `declarative`.

`Imperative` programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task. Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a `for` loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of `declarative` programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the `for` loop mentioned above, you could call the `map` method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

## Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

```JavaScript
// the global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {
  // Add your code below this line

  return fixedValue + 1;
  
  // Add your code above this line
}

var newValue = incrementer(); // Should equal 5
console.log(fixedValue); // Should print 4
```

---

## Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

```JavaScript
// the global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

// Add your code below this line

function incrementer (value) {
  return value + 1;
  
  // Add your code above this line
}

var newValue = incrementer(fixedValue); // Should equal 5
console.log(fixedValue); // Should print 4
```

In the last challenge, the global variable was not altered, but the function `incrementer` would not work without the global variable `fixedValue` being there.

Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

---

## Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

```JavaScript
// the global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

/* This function should add a book to the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

// Add your code below this line

function add (bList, bookName) {
  return bList.concat(bookName);
  
  // Add your code above this line
}

/* This function should remove a book from the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

// Add your code below this line

function remove (bList, bookName) {
  if (bList.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    const index = bList.indexOf(bookName);
    return bList.slice(0, index).concat(bList.slice(index + 1));

    // Add your code above this line
  }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(bookList); // should not change and still equal ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"].

console.log(newBookList); // should equal ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", "A Brief History of Time"].

console.log(newerBookList); // should equal ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"].

console.log(newestBookList); // should equal ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", "A Brief History of Time"].
```

For both functions, I added a new parameter `bList` (named it this way instead of `bookList` since that is the global variable in this case) so I would not be directly modifying the global variable.

For the `add` function I simply use the `concat()` method, a non-mutator method, to combine the passed book list and the passed book name, and then return the new combined array.

For the `remove` function I left the original check to see if the book is already in the list, if not I create an `index` variable which will set the index of the book to the index it has in the list already. I then use the `slice()` method to remove the book by slicing the array up to the index, and then using the `concat()` method to add the rest of the list after the book.

Functions are considered `First Class Objects` in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

The `map()` method is a way to iterate over each item in an array. It creates a new array (it does not alter the original one) after applying a callback function to every element.

In this challenge I used the`map()` method to iterate through the `watchList` array of objects, and return the title and IMDB rating of each value. Using the syntax in which I used `{ title: value.Title, }` I am able to use the defined variable `value` in the callback function of the `map()` method to pull the information I want. So I am pulling the titles of each item in the array and the IMDB rating of each item. This will create a new array of objects, with titles and ratings.

## Implement map on a Prototype

```JavaScript
// the global Array
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback){
  var newArray = [];
  // Add your code below this line

  this.forEach((value, index, array) => newArray.push(callback(value, index, array)));

  // Add your code above this line
  return newArray;

};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item){
  return item * 2;
});
```

`this` is the "old array," since that is what this function is being called on. It loops through everything in that array and returns the newArray with the adjusted values from the passed argument / function.

Including the index and array in this is somewhat optional, it would depend on on what this function would be working with (...I think?). Could write this as: 

```JavaScript
this.forEach(value => newArray.push(callback(value)));
```

The `map()` method returns an array the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

This makes the `map()` a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

You can learn a lot about `map()` by trying to implement a version of it that behaves exactly like the `Array.prototype.map()` with a `for` loop or `Array.prototype.forEach()`.

**A pure function is allowed to alter local variables defined within its scope, although, it's preferable to avoid that as well.**

// Add your code below this line

const filteredList = watchList.filter((movie) => movie.imdbRating >= 8.0).map(value => ({title: value.Title, rating: value.imdbRating}));

// Add your code above this line

console.log(filteredList);
```

I first use the `filter()` method to filter out any titles that have IMDB rating lower than 8.0. I then use the `map()` method on the new list of items to return only the titles and IMDB ratings of the remaining titles.

The `filter()` method returns a new array which is at most as long as the original array, but usually has fewer items.

`Filter()` does not alter the original array, just like `map()`. It takes a callback function that applies the logic inside the callback on each element of the array. If an element returns true based ont he criteria in the callback function, then it is included in the new array.

---

## Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

```JavaScript
// the global Array
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback){
  var newArray = [];
  // Add your code below this line

  this.forEach(value => (callback(value) ? newArray.push(value) : false));

  // Add your code above this line
  return newArray;

};

var new_s = s.myFilter(function(item){
  return item % 2 === 1;
});
```

To recreate the `filter()` method I use the `forEach()` method, instead of using a `for` loop to make this a bit simpler. I iterate through each value to see if the argument being made is true or not. If it is true, I push the value to a `newArray` and if it is false I return false.

To learn more about the `filter()` method, it would be beneficial to try and recreate the method on my own.

**A pure function is allowed to alter local variables defined within its scope, although, it's preferable to avoid that as well.**

---

## Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method

```JavaScript
function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return anim.slice(beginSlice, endSlice);

  // Add your code above this line
}
var inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);
```

The `slice` method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The `slice` method is **not** a `mutator` so it does not alter the original array, but instead returns a new one.

---

## Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice

```JavaScript
function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return cities.slice(0, 3);
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
var inputCities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
nonMutatingSplice(inputCities);
```

While the `splice()` method is very useful for when you want to remove certain items and keep the rest of an array; `splice()` is a `mutator` and modifies the original array it is called on.

Using `slice()` instead of `splice()` helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

---

## Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method

```JavaScript
function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return original.concat(attach);
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
var first = [1, 2, 3];
var second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingConcat(first, second);
```

`Concatenation` means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the `concat()` method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way.

The `concat()` method is **not** a `mutator`.

---

## Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

```JavaScript
function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return original.concat(newItem);
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
var first = [1, 2, 3];
var second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingPush(first, second);
```

---

## Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

```JavaScript
// the global variable
var watchList = [

const moviesByNolan = watchList.filter(movie => movie.Director === 'Christopher Nolan');
const averageRating = moviesByNolan.map(value => value.imdbRating).reduce((prev, cur) => parseFloat(prev) + parseFloat(cur)) / moviesByNolan.length;

// Add your code above this line

console.log(averageRating); 
```

I start off by creating a variable `moviesByNolan` which creates an array of objects by using the `filter()` method to filter out any movie that has "Christopher Nolan" as a director.

I then create a new variable `averageRating` which uses the `map()` method to iterate through the previously created `moviesByNolan` array to retrieve the IMDB ratings. I then use the `reduce()` method on the array of IMDB ratings to add all the ratings together and then divide this total by `moviesByNolan.length` to get the average IMDB rating in which "Christopher Nolan" was a director.

The `reduce()` method is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problems using the `reduce()` method.

The `reduce()` method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both `filter()` and `map()` can be derived as a special application of `reduce()`.

## Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method

```JavaScript
function alphabeticalOrder(arr) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return arr.sort();
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
alphabeticalOrder(["a", "d", "c", "a", "z", "g"]);
```

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.

**It's encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results.**

## Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array

```JavaScript
var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return arr.concat([]).sort();

  // Add your code above this line
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);
```

So you can concat an empty array ([]) with the passed arr, which will return a new array that is equal to the passed array, then you sort the new array.

`concat()` - Joins two or more arrays, and returns a copy of the joined arrays

I can see this being pretty useful as I continue learning. With this I'm currently thinking you can use any of the mutating methods without altering the original array.

## Split a String into an Array Using the split Method

```JavaScript
function splitify(str) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return str.split(/[\W]/);

  // Add your code above this line
}
splitify("Hello World,I-am code");
```

I split the string on any non-word by using the regex token `\W`.

The `split()` method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the `delimiter`, which can be a character to use to break up the string or regular expression.

Since strings are `immutable`, the `split()` method makes it easer to work with them.

---

## Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method

```JavaScript
function sentensify(str) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return str.split(/\W/).join(' ');
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");
```

I used the same regex from the previous challenge to separate the words here. I then use the `join()` method and join the array elements with a single space in-between (`' '`).

The `join()` method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the `delimiter` that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

## Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs

```JavaScript
// the global variable
var globalTitle = "Winter Is Coming";

// Add your code below this line

function urlSlug(title) {
  return title.toLowerCase().split(/\W/).filter(value => value.trim()).join('-');
}

// Add your code above this line

var winterComing = urlSlug(globalTitle); // Should be "winter-is-coming"
```

I first convert the entire passed string (`title`) to all lower case letters using `toLowerCase()`, this returns a new string with all the letters now lowercase. I then use the `split()` method on this new string and split on any non-word character, which will create a new array of each word. I then use the `filter()` method on this array which will iterate through each value, in which I will then use the `trim()` value on each value to remove any whitespace. I then join all the values in the array with the `join()` method and use `-` as a `delimiter` to put a hyphen between each word as a new string; which is then returned.

## Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria

```JavaScript
function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return arr.every(value => value > -1);

  // Add your code above this line
}
checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);
```

The `every()` method works with arrays to check if *every* element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - `true` if all values meet the criteria, `false` if not.

---

## Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria

```JavaScript
function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return arr.some(value => value > -1);
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);
```

The `some` method works with arrays to check if *any* element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - `true` if **any** of the values meet the criteria, `false` if not.

## Introduction to Currying and Partial Application

```JavaScript
function add(x) {
  // Add your code below this line

  return (y) => (z) => x + y + z;
  
  // Add your code above this line
}

add(10)(20)(30);
```

The `arity` of a function is the number of arguments it requires. `Currying` a function means to convert a function of N `arity` into N functions of `arity` 1.

In other-words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

As an example:

```JavaScript
//Un-curried function
function unCurried(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

//Curried function
function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

curried(1)(2) // Returns 3
```

This can be useful if your program can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it is available. Here is an example using the `curried` function in the example above:

```JavaScript
// Call a curried function in parts:
var funcForY = curried(1);
var funcForZ = funcForY(2);
console.log(funcForZ(3)); // Prints 6
```

Similarly, `partial application` can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments.

Here is an example:

```JavaScript
//Impartial function
function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

var partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // Returns 13
```

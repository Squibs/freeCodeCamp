# Legacy Algorithm Files & Notes

These files and notes were from when I first started out doing lessons on freeCodeCamp. There are several `.txt` style of notes, where I just quickly jotted down important things, that I personally, found useful. There are also several individual files for the various algorithm challenges, each of which contain the solutions I came up with. 

I have now gone over these challenges several times now, and have come up with better solutions. However, these files here are the original solutions I came up with. I wanted to keep these around to see how much I have improved.

I wanted to keep my old notes as well, just to take a look back at how I was taking notes before as well. I am glad I have moved onto using Markdown as a way of keeping notes.

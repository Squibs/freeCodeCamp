## Introduction to the Regular Expression Challenges
These sections will cover `regular expressions` or `regex`.

https://regex101.com/ is a great site to help practice and just simply see what regex is matching as you add onto an expression.

---

## Using the Test Method

```JavaScript
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
```

The `.test()` method can be used on regex or a variable storing regex to test a string.

---

## Match Literal Strings

```JavaScript
let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
```

Searching a string for something such as `/Hello/` is searching for a literal match of the string `"Hello"`. It is case sensitive.

---

## Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities

```JavaScript
let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; // Change this line
let result = petRegex.test(petString);
```

It is possible to search for multiple patterns using the `alternation` or `OR` operator: `|`.

---

## Ignore Case While Matching

```JavaScript
let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freeCodeCamp/i; // Change this line
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
```

In order to ignore case sensitivity when searching using regex, you must use a special `flag`. The flag to ignore case is the `i` flag.

---

## Extract Matches

```JavaScript
let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; // Change this line
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex); // Change this line
```

The `.test()` method only returns a `true` or `false` response. Using the `.match()` method instead will extract the matches.

The `.match()` method is used on Strings, rather than Regex.

---

## Find More Than the First Match

```JavaScript
let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
let starRegex = /twinkle/gi; // Change this line
let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); // Change this line
```

So far, you have only been able to extract or search a pattern once.

In order to search or extract a pattern more than once, the `g` (global) flag can be used.

Multiple flags can be applied in a single Regex.

---

## Match Anything with Wildcard Period

```JavaScript
let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
```

The wildcard character for Regex is `.` . This will allow you to search for any one character.

---

## Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
```

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with `character classes`; which allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside of square brackets (`[` `]`).

---

## Match Letters of the Alphabet

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); // Change this line
```

Inside a `character set`, you can define a range of characters to match using a `hyphen` character `-`.

---

## Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /[2-6h-s]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // Change this line
```

The `hyphen` character can be used to match a range of numbers as well.

---

## Match Single Characters Not Specified

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /[^0-9aeiou]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // Change this line
```

`Negated character sets` are useful for when you want to state characters you do not want to match. This is done with the `caret` character (`^`) **inside of a `character set`**.

The use of a `^` changes when it is used outside of a `character set` (`[` `]`).

---

## Match Characters that Occur One or More Times

```JavaScript
let difficultSpelling = "Mississippi";
let myRegex = /s+/gi; // Change this line
let result = difficultSpelling.match(myRegex);
```

In order to check if a character appears **one or more** times in a row the `+` character can be used.

Examples:
- `/a+/g` would find one match in `"abc"` and return `["a"]`.
- `/a+/g` would find one match in `"aabc"` and return `["aa"]`.
- `/a+/g` would find two matches in `"abab"` and return `["a", "a"]` (the characters were not in a row, so it returns two matches, each a single letter `"a"`).

---

## Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times

```JavaScript
let chewieQuote = "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!";
let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; // Change this line
let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
```

OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
let starWars = "Star Wars";
let starWarsRegex = /Star Wars*/; // Change this line
let result = starWars.match(starWarsRegex);
```

When you want to check if a character appears **zero or more** times, the `asterisk` or `star` (`*`) character can be used.

```JavaScript
let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go*/;
soccerWord.match(goRegex); // Returns ["goooooooo"]
gPhrase.match(goRegex);    // Returns ["g"]
oPhrase.match(goRegex);    // Returns null
```

---

## Find Characters with Lazy Matching

```JavaScript
let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.*?>/; // Change this line
let result = text.match(myRegex);
```

A `greedy` match finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern. A `lazy` match find the smallest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern.

Regular expressions by default are `greedy`.

The use of the `?` character can change a regex pattern to return a `lazy` matching.

For example:
- `/t[a-z]*i/` would return `"titani"` from the string `"titanic"`.
- `/t[a-z]*?i/` would return `"ti"` from the string `"titanic"`.

---

## Find One or More Criminals in a Hunt

```JavaScript
// example crowd gathering
let crowd = 'P1P2P3P4P5P6CCCP7P8P9';

let reCriminals = /C+/; // Change this line

let matchedCriminals = crowd.match(reCriminals);
console.log(matchedCriminals);
```

The `global` flag is not needed for this challenge. The criminals "stay close together when they are around other people", they would not be split up.

---

## Match Beginning String Patterns

```JavaScript
let rickyAndCal = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
let calRegex = /^Cal/; // Change this line
let result = calRegex.test(rickyAndCal);
```

When a `caret` character is used **outside** of a `character set` it will search for patterns that start at the beginning of a string.

---

## Match Ending String Patterns

```JavaScript
let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /caboose$/; // Change this line
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
```

To search for a pattern that ends at the end of a string the `dollar sign` (`$`) can be used.

---

## Match All Letters and Numbers

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/g; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;
```

There are several character classes that are common enough to warrant having a shortcut. The use of `[a-z]` is used frequently enough that there is a `shorthand character class` for it.

`\w` is shorthand for `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.

---

## Match Everything But Letters and Numbers

```JavaScript
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let nonAlphabetRegex = /\W/g; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(nonAlphabetRegex).length;
```

Each `shorthand character class` will typically have a slight variant, which comes from simply capitalizing the letter used (usually the opposite).

`\W` is shorthand for `[^A-Za-z0-9_]` (note the `caret`).

---

## Match All Numbers

```JavaScript
let numString = "Your sandwich will be $5.00";
let numRegex = /\d/g; // Change this line
let result = numString.match(numRegex).length;
```

`\d` is another `shorthand character class` which is used to search for a single character of any number between zero and nine.

---

## Match All Non-Numbers

```JavaScript
let numString = "Your sandwich will be $5.00";
let noNumRegex = /\D/g; // Change this line
let result = numString.match(noNumRegex).length;
```

`\D` is used to search for a single character that is not a number between zero and nine.

---

## Restrict Possible Usernames

```JavaScript
let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /^\D\w+/; // Change this line
let result = userCheck.test(username);
```

I feel if there were more test cases, my solution might not match all the requirements, so the provided solution might be better. But with the test cases used, I feel mine works just as well.

The problem with my solution is when a username such as "B1" comes up, it will match that username, when usernames that are two characters long can only use alphabet letter characters.

Another problem is the use of `\w`, this matches underscores, as well as numbers, which is not the same as searching for only alphabet characters.

So in saying all of this, a shorter solution than the provided one could be: `/[a-z][a-z]+\d*\i` this can be shortened further to: 

`/[a-z]{2,}\d*/i` . This uses a `quantity specifier` to state to look for matches between 2 and unlimited times, as many times as possible.

Provided solution is:

```JavaScript
var username = "JackOfAllTrades";
var userCheck = /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]+[0-9]*/; // Change this line
var result = userCheck.test(username);
```

---

## Match Whitespace

```JavaScript
let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g; // Change this line
let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);
```

`\s` is used to match whitespace and is shorthand for `[ \r\t\f\n\v]`.

This matches carriage returns (`\r`), tabs (`\t`), form-feeds (`\f`), newline characters (`\n`), and vertical whitespace characters (`\v`).

---

## Match Non-Whitespace Characters

```JavaScript
let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countNonWhiteSpace = /\S/g; // Change this line
let result = sample.match(countNonWhiteSpace);
```

`\S` can be used to match all non-whitespace characters.

---

## Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches

```JavaScript
var ohStr = "Ohhh no";
var ohRegex = /Oh{3,6} no/; // Change this line
var result = ohRegex.test(ohStr);
```

`Quantity specifiers` are used with curly brackets (`{` `}`) in which you put two numbers, one for the lower and upper number of patterns, to search a certain range of patterns.

---

## Specify Only the Lower Number of Matches

```JavaScript
let haStr = "Hazzzzah";
let haRegex = /Haz{4,}ah/; // Change this line
let result = haRegex.test(haStr);
```

If you leave out the second number in a `quantity specifier` you can look for a pattern that appears at least a certain number of times or more.

---

## Specify Exact Number of Matches

```JavaScript
let timStr = "Timmmmber";
let timRegex = /Tim{4}ber/; // Change this line
let result = timRegex.test(timStr);
```

Putting just a single digit in a `quantity specifier` will search for that amount of specific matches.

---

## Check for All or None

```JavaScript
let favWord = "favorite";
let favRegex = /favou?rite/; // Change this line
let result = favRegex.test(favWord);
```

You can check for the existence of an element with a question mark, `?`. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element.

You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.

---

## Positive and Negative Lookahead

```JavaScript
let sampleWord = "astronaut";
let pwRegex = /(?=\w{5,})(?=\D*\d{2})/; // Change this line
let result = pwRegex.test(sampleWord);
```

`Lookaheads` are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along.

There are two kinds of `lookaheads`: `positive lookahead` and `negative lookahead`.

A `positive lookahead` will make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it `(?=...)`.

A `negative lookahead` will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there `(?!...)`.

Some examples:

```JavaScript
let quit = "qu";
let noquit = "qt";
let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
quit.match(quRegex); // Returns ["q"]
noquit.match(qRegex); // Returns ["q"]
```

A common use of `lookaheads` is to check two or more patterns in one string.

```JavaScript
let password = "abc123";
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password); // Returns true
```

This looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number.

---

## Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups

```JavaScript
var repeatNum = "42 42 42";
var reRegex = /^(\d+)\s\1\s\1$/; // Change this line
var result = reRegex.test(repeatNum);
```

You can search for repeat substrings using `capture groups`. Parentheses (`(` `)`) are used to find repeat substrings.

A backslash (`\`) is used to specify where a repeat string will appear, and then a number.

Example:

```JavaScript
let repeatStr = "regex regex";
let repeatRegex = /(\w+)\s\1/;
repeatRegex.test(repeatStr); // Returns true
repeatStr.match(repeatRegex); // Returns ["regex regex", "regex"]
```

---

## Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace

```JavaScript
let huhText = "This sandwich is good.";
let fixRegex = /good/; // Change this line
let replaceText = "okey-dokey"; // Change this line
let result = huhText.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);
```

You can use the `.replace()` method change ("replace") the text you match.

---

## Remove Whitespace from Start and End

```JavaScript
let hello = "   Hello, World!  ";
let wsRegex = /\s{2,}/g; // Change this line
let result = hello.replace(wsRegex, ''); // Change this line
```

Provided solution:

```JavaScript
var hello = "   Hello, World!  ";
var wsRegex = /^\s+|\s+$/g; // Change this line
var result = hello.replace(wsRegex, ''); // Change this line
```

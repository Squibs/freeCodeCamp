This project took me a while to figure out how to get started. Only some of the [Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai](../1.%20Quality%20Assurance%20and%20Testing%20with%20Chai.md#quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai) section stuck with me. As I looked up information on unit testing in JavaScript I was met with a lot of different information. `Mocha` is our test framework, and `chai` is a assertion library that can run in a number of different test frameworks, although `chai` prefers `mocha`. As I went through various parts of documentation for both `mocha` and `chai` I learned there are different methods to how you can create these tests.

The moment I started to understand was when I found this post: [The Difference Between TDD and BDD](https://joshldavis.com/2013/05/27/difference-between-tdd-and-bdd/). Basically there are different ways you can write tests. `TDD` is more of a programmatic way of doing tests, while `BDD` is more verbose or human sentence way of doing tests. The previous freeCodeCamp section, linked in the last paragraph, focused on this `TDD` method.

Both `mocha` and `chai` have different syntax you can use, which I imagine is to match these different ways of doing unit testing. `Mocha` has `describe`/`it` vs `suite`/`test`, for these `BDD`/`TDD` [interfaces](https://mochajs.org/#interfaces). Meanwhile `chai` has `expect`/`should` vs `assert` [assertion styles](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assertion-styles).

I learned more about `regex`, as that was used several times throughout this project. I thought I was pretty capable when it came to `regex`, but I did make some mistakes here that cost me a bit of time when I tried to use some new `regex` tokens. I usually use [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) to test out my `regex`. I forgot to switch to the `JavaScript` *flavor* here and was confused when I kept getting weird results in `JavaScript`. I was trying to use `subroutines` where *Regex101* was telling me that `?n` would basically repeat the expression for the `n` capture group. In `JavaScript` I would get an error that my expression was invalid. I thought, alright, and after a bit I found that there as `\n`, which sounded similar enough to me. This was incorrect, as this only repeats the capture if it is the exact same words or numbers that were captured in the first group. So `axaxa` would match but `axbxc` would not match with the `regex` of `([a-c])x\1x\1`. It turns out `JavaScript` is missing some parts of `regex` [Using Regular Expressions with JavaScript](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-javascript.html) --- [Cannot make backreferences work as subroutines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50552573/reuse-capturing-group-pattern-in-js-regex/50553431#50553431).

At the end, finishing this project, I feel more comfortable writing these unit tests. I am still uncertain in how I would work this in for my own projects, or just the mindset in general of how to go about implementing unit testing. I can see three ways of doing so. Adding unit testing after you have created a function, before you create a function, or as you are creating a function. I can see some challenges with that could come up at any stage of implementation, but I do see the benefits in doing so.

We had to handle one route for this project. On this route there was a `get`, `post`, `put` and `delete` to handle records of `issues` for a project where the route had a `parameter` which was the project this `issue` would be assigned to. Initially I was going to create two different `collections` for this project: a `issues` collection and a `projects` collection. However I decided to keep it simple and only have one. If this project was going to go any further I would definitely separate them and add a `project_id` on each issue to relate them.

`Mongoose` does not return a normal JavaScript object. So when I make a `post` request the object the `create` method returns cannot be modified using the `delete` keyword. I have to convert this object using the `toObject` method in-order to then use the `delete` keyword to return an object that only has the properties I want. This was mainly to remove the auto generated `__v` field. There are other ways to accomplish this same thing. I could have created a new object and just assigned what I wanted in that, but I was stuck on the idea of using the `delete` keyword to learn something new. [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23342558/why-cant-i-delete-a-mongoose-models-object-properties/23372028#23372028) is what led me to the solution I was looking for.

This project is very comparable to the previous projects. In this project we have to handle the routes `/api/book` which returns a list of all the books and the comments for that book and the route `api/book/{book_id}` which retrieves a single book and it's comments. There is not a whole lot to say about this project that would be any different from the previous two.

I made use of the `deleteMany` model method in this project. This can find matching database objects with the given parameters, then deletes any that match. This can be used to delete all comments that are specific to one book, if that one book is to be deleted. I also used it for the `delete all books...` button, to remove all books and again all comments when the button is pressed.

Like the previous challenge I had to end up converting the `mongoose` objects into normal JavaScript objects. This time I used `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))` to do the conversion several times, as there are many of the `mongoose` objects returned in an array. `toObject()` or `toJSON()` would be less helpful in this situation, and stringifying and parsing the data seemed like a much better solution compared to iterating over the array and converting each object.

This project was again not dissimilar to the other projects of this *Quality Assurance* section. The real challenge of this project was coming up with the logic to check if the placement of a value in the puzzle was valid, or solving the entire puzzle itself.

I wanted to see if I could come up with a solution to solving sudoku puzzles on my own and for the most part I did just that. I was able to check individual rows, columns and regions if the placement of a value was valid or not. I found checking a region to be much more involved compared to checking a row or a column, and I feel like my solution for checking a region is over engineered. However, it is working.

I tried for a while to come up with a solution to solving the actual sudoku puzzle on my own, but in the end I didn't quite come up with a solution that was going to work. There are several algorithms people have made in order to solve sudoku puzzles, and the one I ended up following was from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/).

Essentially, through a recursive function, this algorithm starts in the top left corner of the puzzle and works through the row solving each square, before moving onto the next row. If at any point a placed value ends up not being correct, the function will fall back to a previously placed unit and try the next valid unit and try to solve again. This continues until the puzzle is solved, or the puzzle is deemed unsolvable. I replaced the region, row, and column checking in this algorithm with my own checking.

In the end I am satisfied with what I came up with solve sudoku puzzles. I have previously never really done sudoku puzzles, and had to play a few puzzles to remember how they even were solved in the first place.

## American British Translator

<p align="center"><img src="/Images/screenshots/screenshot-american-british-translator.png" height="400" alt="Screenshot of my American British Translator project."/></p>

Figuring out a way to incorporate all the different *translations* for this project took a bit of time. I initially believed it was going to be pretty straight forward, but then I realized the method I was using to translate was not accounting for two words in sequence to equal another word or vice versa.

Initially I just split the passed string into an array and checked if each word matched the pre-defined translation object keys and replaced the word with the value of the key if it matched the word. Once I figured out there were words that were two words going to one such as "front desk" to "reception", I had to rethink how I was going to do the translations. In the end I decided to use regex along with the string method `replaceAll`. I would just iterate through the pre-defined translation object and insert each key into a new regex object similar to `/\b{wordToTranslate}\b/`. I added word boundaries as there were also similar words such as "trash" and "trashcan". This allowed me to translate words correctly.

The word boundary method wouldn't work for titles, as the period in the american title would throw it off, so I had to leave word boundaries off for those translations. This wasn't much of a problem, because none of the titles would match in the way "trash" and "trashcan" does in the `replaceAll` method. Finally I had to handle times, and that was as simple as going back to breaking the string to translate into an array again and test if each word matches `/\b\d+:\d+\b/` and replacing the `:` with a `.`.

After further testing and making the unit tests. I found out my `/\b{wordToTranslate}\b/` regex test worked for almost everything, but another case of two words in succession kept this from working completely. Translating the word `chippy` to american english `fish-and-chip shop` would trigger another translation of `chip shop` and cause an issue of the word `chippy` to translate to `fish-and-fish-and-chip shop`. I had to find another solution and came up with using a negative lookahead with a negative lookbehind. `(?<![\\w-]){word}(?![\\w-])` finally gave me the results I was looking for. This would work with titles as well, because I am no longer looking for a word boundary and instead making sure there is no connecting word or hyphen behind or ahead of the word I'm translating.

I did have repeated code between the two different translation methods *british to american* and *american to british* and could have used several ternary operators to fix this, however I felt keeping them separate would allow for further modification to translations going one way or another that might be more unique to one another. On-top-of keeping it more readable and easier to debug instead of figuring out where switching between one translation and another went wrong.

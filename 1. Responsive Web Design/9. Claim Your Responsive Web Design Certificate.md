# Claim Your Responsive Web Design Certificate

<em>**Officially received August 14, 2018** - unofficially around June 20, 2018</em>

*Verify my certification at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/squibs/responsive-web-design*

I achieved/earned this certification earlier than the Issued date, probably around June 20, 2018 (around the time I completed my [Technical Documentation Page](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/1.%20Responsive%20Web%20Design/8.%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20Projects.md#build-a-technical-documentation-page)). The reason for the displayed date is simply due to me working off of the beta lessons and project available when freeCodeCamp had a beta website up and the certification process was not available at that time.

Admittedly, I have gone through many of the lessons available on freeCodeCamp several times now, due to life-complications and wanting to retouch on what I have learned. This certification is very similar to the one I have earned previously from freeCodeCamp, and what I had to say previously upon earning my *Front End Development Certification* (now a legacy certification) still holds true:

> ## My Front End Development Certification (**Legacy**)

> 
> <em>Received August 10, 2017</em>
> 
> Here it is, my **Front End Development Certification**. I have been working towards this since I started learning on freeCodeCamp. I began my journey on *May 3, 2017*; roughly 98 days later I have received this certification.
> 
> I started out knowing only a small amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had only really previous made *[Learning to Necro](http://learningtonecro.com/)* a website I created around the time **Guild Wars 2** came out in *August of 2012*. I can definitely see a huge improvement from where I first started.
> 
> I feel pretty confident in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript having gone this far. I feel like I can work my way through quite a bit. I still have to look things up in order to accomplish things; but no where near as much as I originally did. I have created many things in which I am quite happy about.
> 
> As far as aesthetics go my favorite project I have made so far would probably be my [Wikipedia Viewer](https://squibs.github.io/wikipedia-viewer/):
> 
> <img src="/Images/screenshots/screenshot-wikipedia-viewer.png" height="300" alt="Screenshot of my Wikipedia Viewer project / website."/>
> 
> I am just so very pleased with myself in the color choices and just the general modern-ish look I have created with this project.
> 
> As far as my overall favorite project I have created, it would probably be my [portfolio page](https://squibs.github.io/):
> 
> <img src="/Images/screenshots/screenshot-personal-portfolio-webpage.png" height="250" alt="Screenshot of my Portfolio project / website."/>
> 
> My portfolio was only the second real project I created, following my Tribute Page to John M. Keynes. This project was with me from the start, and I have been updating it with every new project I have finished. While I feel I have learned enough to greatly improve my portfolio page design a lot, I feel I should wait a while longer before giving it a overhaul.
> 
> It's been quite a journey to this point, however I still have a lot to learn. I look forward to continuing on through the freeCodeCamp lessons and projects and continuing to improve my own skills and abilities in web development.

This legacy certification has since been updated with the official release of the previous beta content on freeCodeCamp:

Just a few closing thoughts to add to what I have written previously, now that I have these two certifications next to each other.

The [Technical Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/Sulph/full/yXMqaW/) I created, would now be added to my favorite projects from the *Responsive Web Design* / *Front End Development* sections:

I just like how this project turned out for me. It just has a simple look to it, with a bit of responsiveness depending on screen/window size and just simply looks like what a technical document might look like.

I would also like to point out that there were several other, now legacy, projects that went into getting these certifications. You can check out the rest of these projects in the [Coding Interview Prep and freeCodeCamp Legacy Projects](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/7.%Coding%20Interview%20Prep%20and%20freeCodeCamp%20Legacy%20Projects#coding-interview-prep-and-freecodecamp-legacy-projects) section of this repository.

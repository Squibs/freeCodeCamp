## Get Set for our Responsive Web Design Projects

This is just an introductory for the following projects on the beta freeCodeCamp website. I'll include general notes about the projects below here.

The projects in the <em>Responsive Web Design Projects</em> folder are mostly modified versions of my previously completed projects that I did before switching to the beta version of freeCodeCamp. I edited these projects to include the <em>Test Suite</em> that freeCodeCamp seems to be implementing to test out the user cases for main projects. 

<strong>For a more updated version of each of these projects, follow the link to the live website / project link I'll include in each of these sections.</strong>

## Build a Tribute Page

<em>Completed May 05, 2017</em>

The very first <em>Basic Front End Development Project</em> (now known as <em>Applied Responsive Web Design Projects</em>) I completed on freeCodeCamp. I made a tribute page to John M. Keynes a 20th century British economist. This was the first project / challenge that did not give any step-by-step directions and instead let the learner go off of just an example and some user stories as an end-goal (user stories now in the <em>Test Suite</em>).

For this project I used some Bootstrap 4.0.0 alpha classes; mainly a 'Card' for the image, as they removed thumbnails in this version of Bootstrap.

<em>Completed June 16, 2017</em>

This is the second <em>Responsive Web Design Project</em> on freeCodeCamp. This project was mostly about working with forms.  I decided to do a two-column layout for my forum with the labels on the left and the input fields on the right.

The page does not handle any information submitted as freeCodeCamp did not go over how one would handle this at the time in which I created this.

<em>Completed June 19, 2017</em>

For this <em>Responsive Web Design Project</em> I decided to create a product landing page for a pair of shoes. I looked through shoes until I found one that had colors that stood out to me and I then could use the accent color as an accent color on the page I was going to build for it.

<em>Completed June 20, 2017</em>

For this project I was tasked with creating a technical documentation page. I decided to recreate the manual that came with my AMD Ryzen CPU. The navigation contains each heading in order to quickly get to any section.

freeCodeCamp had several user stories, which included using tables, code, and other various html elements in order to create this project.

### [Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://squibs.github.io/) (Click to view functional site on GitHub Pages)

<em>Completed May 23, 2017</em>

I created for the second <em>Basic Front End Development Project</em> from freeCodeCamp. I created a portfolio for myself to feature projects and let people know a little about myself. It includes a contact form which can send an email to me directly from the web page itself using Formspree. There are many improvements I can still yet make, and those will come later once I learn more.

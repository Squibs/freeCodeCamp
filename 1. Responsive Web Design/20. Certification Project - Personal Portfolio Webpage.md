## [Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://squibs.github.io/) (Click to view functional site on GitHub Pages)

*Completed May 23, 2017*

I created a portfolio, for myself, and to feature projects as well as let people know a little about myself. It includes a contact form which can send an email to me directly, which is sent from the page itself using Formspree. There are many improvements I can still yet make, and those will come later once I learn more.

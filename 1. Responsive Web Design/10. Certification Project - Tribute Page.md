*Completed May 05, 2017*

This is the second project in the now redesigned Responsive Web Design curriculum on freeCodeCamp. Originally this was my first project I created. This is what I had to say about the project at the time:

>The very first *Basic Front End Development Project* (now known as *Applied Responsive Web Design Projects*) I completed on freeCodeCamp. I made a tribute page to John M. Keynes a 20th century British economist. This was the first project / challenge that did not give any step-by-step directions and instead let the learner go off of just an example and some user stories as an end-goal (user stories now in the *Test Suite*).
>
>For this project I used some Bootstrap 4.0.0 alpha classes; mainly a 'Card' for the image, as they removed thumbnails in this version of Bootstrap.

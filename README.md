# freeCodeCamp

The lesson solutions and projects I have created while going through the coding lessons and project challenges at freeCodeCamp.org.

I used to have two separate repositories dedicated to freeCodeCamp, one for the beta site and one for the original/legacy lessons. freeCodeCamp has since released the beta lessons to the main site, and I have now merged my two repositories into this one.

Click the links below to navigate through each section and view the solutions I came up with for challenges and my completed projects. If a section is ~~crossed out~~, I have not yet finished the section and will update this list when I complete it in the future.

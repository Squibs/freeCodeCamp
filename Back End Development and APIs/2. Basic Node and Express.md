## Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges

`Node.js` is an open source server/run-time environment. `Express` is a minimal and flexible framework for Node.js that is designed for building web applications and APIs. Express is used for the backend part of the `MEAN stack`.

I've used `Express` in a way in my React boilerplate project, with `webpack dev server`. Which is essentially just a pre-configured express server; I could switch to using my own configuration as I learn more about Node.js and Express.

**You can view this project and project files: [On Glitch!](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-squibs-express?path=myApp.js)**

**I have created a backup of the project files: [Here](./fcc-squibs-express/)**

## Meet the Node console

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 1) Meet the node console. */
console.log('Hello World');

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

Node is just a JavaScript environment, so you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see the console output in a terminal.

---

## Start a Working Express Server

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 2) A first working Express Server */
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello Express'));

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

The first two lines of the file myAp.js demonstrate how to create an Express app object. This object has several methods, that will be part of many of these challenges in this *Basic Node and Express* section.

One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`, this tells the server to listen on the specified port, which puts it into a running state (the commented out part at end of file).

In Express, routes take the following structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`. METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (which can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched.

Handlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. As an example:

```JavaScript
function (req, res) {
  res.send('Response String');
}
```

serves the string 'Response String'.

---

## Serve an HTML File

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 3) Serve an HTML file */
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(`${__dirname}/views/index.html`);
});

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

You can respond with a file using the method `res.sendFile(path)`. 

You can put it inside the `app.get('/', ...)` route handler. Behind the scenes this method will set the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type. Then it will read and send the file. This method needs an absolute file path. There is a global variable `__dirname` that can calculate this absolute file path (`absolutePath = __dirname + relativePath/file.ext`).

---

## Serve Static Assets

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 4) Serve static assets  */
app.use('/public', express.static(`${__dirname}/public`));

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

An HTML server usually has one or more directories that are accessible by the user. You can place there the static assets needed by your application. In Express you can put in place this functionality using middleware `express.static(path)`, where the parameter is the absolute path of the folder containing the assets.

Middlewares are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information. A middleware needs to be mounted using the method `app.use(path, middlewareFunction)`. The first path argument is optional, if it is not passed - the middleware will be executed for all the requests.

---

## Serve JSON on a Specific Route

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 5) serve JSON on a specific route */
app.get('/json', (req, res) => res.json({ message: "Hello json" }));

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

An HTML server serves HTML, however an API serves data. A REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API allows data exchange in a simple way, without the need for clients to know where the resource is (the URL), and the action it wants to perform on it (the verb).

Two common verbs used are GET and POST. The GET verb is used when you are fetching information. The POST verb is used when you are sending data to the server to create/update a resource. JSON is a very popular/preferred data format for moving information around the web.

---

## Use the .env File

```BASH
###### .env file ######
# Environment Config

# store your secrets and config variables in here
# only invited collaborators will be able to see your .env values

# reference these in your code with process.env.SECRET

SECRET=
MADE_WITH=
MESSAGE_STYLE=uppercase

# note: .env is a shell file so there can't be spaces around =
```

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 6) Use the .env file to configure the app */
app.get('/json', (req, res) => {
  const responseObject = { message: "Hello json" };
  if (process.env.MESSAGE_STYLE === 'uppercase')
    responseObject.message = responseObject.message.toUpperCase();
  res.json(responseObject);
});

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

The `.env` file is a hidden file that is used to pass environment variables to your application. This file is secret, no one but you can access it, and it can be used to store data that you want to keep private or hidden. API keys from external services or your database URI can be stored in this file. Configuration options can also be put into this file, which allows your application to change its configuration without the need to rewrite some code, if used properly.

The environment variables are accessible from the app as `process.env.VAR_NAME`. The `process.env` object is a global Node object, and variables are passed as strings. By convention the variable names are all uppercase with words separated by an underscore.

---

## Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// --> 7)  Mount the Logger middleware here
// express evaluates routes from top to bottom
// so we want this custom middleware at the top
// so it logs this information for every route
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path} - ${req.ip}`);
  next();
});

...

/** 7) Root-level Middleware - A logger */
//  place it before all the routes !

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. As stated previously these functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects.

```JavaScript
function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("I'm a middleware...");
  next();
}
```

Let’s suppose we mounted this function on a route. When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”. Then it executes the next function in the stack.

## Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 8) Chaining middleware. A Time server */
app.get('/now', (req, res, next) => {
  req.time = `${new Date()}`;
  next();
}, (req, res) => {
  res.send({ time: req.time });
});

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

Middleware can be mounted at a specific route using `app.METHOD(path, middlewareFunction)`. Middleware can also be chained inside route definition.

```JavaScript
app.get('/user', function(req, res, next) {
  req.user = getTheUserSync(); // Hypothetical synchronous operation
  next();
}, function(req, res) {
  res.send(req.user);
});
```

This approach is useful to split the server operations into smaller units. That leads to a better app structure, and the possibility to reuse code in different places. This approach can also be used to perform some validation on the data. At each point of the middleware stack you can block the execution of the current chain and pass control to functions specifically designed to handle errors. Or you can pass control to the next matching route, to handle special cases.

## Get Route Parameter Input from the Client

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 9)  Get input from client - Route parameters */
app.get('/:word/echo', (req, res) => res.json({ echo: `${req.params.word}` }));

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

Route parameters are named segments of the URL, delimited by slashes (/). Each segment captures the value of the part of the URL which matches its position. The captured values can be found in the `req.params` object.

```
route_path: '/user/:userId/book/:bookId'
actual_request_URL: 'user/546/book/6754'
req.params: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}
```

Here you can see that `:userId` is pointing to the user ID and `:bookId` is pointing to the book ID.

For this challenge we have set it up so that a word (`:word`) will be echoed if the URL ends in `/echo`. For example `https://fcc-squibs-express.glitch.me/freeCodeCamp/echo` will respond with some JSON: `{"echo": "freeCodeCamp"}`. 
This can be tested at this link https://fcc-squibs-express.glitch.me/freeCodeCamp/echo. Just replace `freeCodeCamp`  in the URL with any other word.

---

## Get Query Parameter Input from the Client

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 10) Get input from client - Query parameters */
// /name?first=<firstname>&last=<lastname>
// app.get('/name', (req, res) => res.send({ name: `${req.query.first} ${req.query.last}` }));
app.route('/name').get((req, res) => res.send({ name: `${req.query.first} ${req.query.last}` }))

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separate by an ampersand(&). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object `req.query`.

```
route_path: '/library'
actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&bookId=6754'
req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}
```

Here you can see that the `userId` and `bookId` is extracted from the URL.

I live example can be tested here: https://fcc-squibs-express.glitch.me/name?first=Zachary&last=Holman. Just replace the first and last name parameters in the URL with whatever combination you please to see the result of the returned JSON.

## Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// --> 11)  Mount the body-parser middleware here
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

...

/** 11) Get ready for POST Requests - the `body-parser` */
// place it before all the routes !

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

In POST requests the data doesn't appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. THis is a part of the HTML request, also called payload. Since HTML is text based, even if you don't see the data, it doesn't mean that they are secret. The raw content of an HTTP POST request is shown below:

```
POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0
From: john@example.com
User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20
name=John+Doe&age=25
```

As you can see the body is encoded like the query string. This is the default format used by HTML forms. With Ajax, we can also use JSON to be able to handle data having a  more complex structure. There is another type of encoding: multipart/form-data - this is used to upload binary files.

The middleware to handle URL encoded data is returned by `bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false})`. `extended=false` is a configuration option that tells the parser to use the classic encoding. When using it, values can be only strings or arrays. The extended version allows more data flexibility, but it is outmatched by JSON.

---

## Get Data from POST Requests

```JavaScript
// myApp.js file
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

...

/** 10) Get input from client - Query parameters */
// /name?first=<firstname>&last=<lastname>
app.route('/name')
  .get((req, res) => res.send({ name: `${req.query.first} ${req.query.last}` }))

/** 12) Get data form POST  */
  .post((req, res) => res.json({ name: `${req.body.first} ${req.body.last}` }));

...

// This would be part of the basic setup of an Express app
// but to allow FCC to run tests, the server is already active
/** app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000 ); */

//---------- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --------------------
 module.exports = app;
```

This uses the form (see form here: https://fcc-squibs-express.glitch.me/) to do the same thing in an earlier challenge (/post in the URL) only now we are getting the name from the form rather than directly from the URL.

The first *Back End Development and APIs Project* I completed for freeCodeCamp. This entire section of freeCodeCamp seemed to be quite short lesson wise. There was only a total of 34 lessons, before the projects were the only thing left to do.

This project reminded me of how much of a hassle it is to work with `Date` objects. In the future I will more than likely use a JavaScript library to hopefully make working with them a whole lot easier.

For this project we had to handle two different api routes: `/api` and `/api/:date`. Both return the same JSON object of format `{ "unix" : 1451001600000, "utc" : "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }`. If no valid date is passed as a parameter we simply return `{ "error": "Invalid Date" }`.

The `/api` route was fairly straight forward, we just return the current time in both `unix` and `utc` formats. Just make a new `Date` and use the `Date.getTime()` method for `unix` and the `Date.toUTCString()` method for `utc`.

The `/api/:date` route was where the project got slightly tricky. We needed to handle any valid date string, which means we need to figure out a way to see if a string can become a valid date. I opted to right-away convert the string to a date object and store it. I then test if the string is just numbers with `regex` and if it is cast the string to a `Number` and overwrite the previously stored date object with a new date object. Finally I test if the date object is valid, and if not return the appropriate error JSON.

### Required *User Stories* for this project

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- A request to `/api/:date?` with a valid date should return a JSON object with a `unix` key that is a Unix timestamp of the input date in milliseconds (as type Number)
- A request to `/api/:date?` with a valid date should return a JSON object with a `utc` key that is a string of the input date in the format: `Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT`
- A request to `/api/1451001600000` should return `{ unix: 1451001600000, utc: "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }`
- Your project can handle dates that can be successfully parsed by `new Date(date_string)`
- If the input date string is invalid, the api returns an object having the structure `{ error : "Invalid Date" }`
- An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a `unix` key
- An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a `utc` key

Unfortunately I don't think I'll have much to say about this project.

Like the last project we need to handle a route, this time we are handling `/api/whoami`. This will return JSO with three key value pairs: `ipaddress` which will return the visitor's IP address, `language` which returns the natural language and locale that the client prefers, and finally `software` which returns information recording to the used application, operating system, and a few more details.

All of these can be retrieved using the `req` object. I this project off by simply `console.log`ging the `req` object and searching through the output for my IP. I then returned this information using `req.headers['x-forwarded-for']`. This was the same for the other information using: `req.headers['accept-language']` and `req.headers['user-agent']`.

This quickly ended the project, as this was accepted as solving all the user stories / requirements for this project.

I decided this was too simple and looked at the solutions other's created. Turns out `express` has the `req.get` method, which can generally do what I did above, just in a different format: `req.get('user-agent')`. I decided this is probably the better way to handle getting this information, as it is a built-in function.

Then one last change I made was retrieving the IP address in a different way. `Express` provides the `req.ip` property that contains the remote IP address of the request. However this returns the IP in the format similar to: `::fff:159.20.14.100`. To resolve this I set `app.enable('trust proxy')` so that `express` will attempt to determine the IP address of the client connected through "the front-facing proxy, or a series of proxies."

This project was more like how I thought the rest of these project might have been, so it was slightly rough to get started. The previous projects provided everything you needed to get going, and this one only provided some of it.

To start off I added `Mongoose` and `MongoDB` to the included `package.json` so these packages would be included. Probably didn't need to include `MongoDB`, as `Mongoose` would have that as a dependency, but that's okay.

For this project we need to handle two different routes. `/api/shorturl/:short` which handles redirecting to a website that has already been submitted, and `/api/shortul/` which handles `POST` requests from the form submission. Redirecting is no problem, I just used the `Model.findOne` method, and if a result is found then redirect to the site. If no site is found then respond with an error JSON object instead. Handling the POST request was where the real challenge of this project started.

The first thing to do is verify the submitted link is valid. There was a hint to use `dns.lookup(host, cb)` from the `dns` core node module. However, this is not what I did. Looking through the documentation for node's `url.parse` method, I noticed it was deprecated, which led me to finding out there is a `URL` object that you can use instead. Which eventually led me back to freeCodeCamp with the article [How to Check if a JavaScript String is a Valid URL](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/check-if-a-javascript-string-is-a-url/), after I messed around with the `URL` object for a little while. I ended up using the solution of trying to store the string into a new `URL` object, and catching any errors. If there are errors, it's not a valid `URL` object, and I was able to move on from there.

The next step is determining if the submitted link already exists in the database, which I already did for the other route, so this was simple. After that if the link does not yet exist, I needed to find out how make a sequence type value on these objects I'm storing in the database, so they won't end up with the same `short_url`, and how to get that value so I can increment it for the next stored `URL`. I found the `Model.estimatedDocumentCount` method, which I feel like isn't an actual proper choice for this, but it ended up working in the end. Once I get the count, I can create and store this new `URL` object in my database with an attached `short_url` number and finally redirect the user to the response object which is their submitted `URL` and it's `short_url`.

This was the first of these *Back End Development and APIs* projects that I felt challenged, and had to learn more about `Mongoose` and `MongoDB` rather than using what I learned in the short lessons before these projects.

This provided boilerplate for this project was slightly more bare-bones than the previous, this time the `body-parser` package was not included. So the only packages I included this time were: `body-parser` and `mongoose`.

I quickly setup a `userSchema` as well as an `exerciseSchema`, that will be related through a field on `exerciseSchema` called `user_id` that is a reference to the `_id` that will be auto-generated on `users` (as well as all objects stored in mongo), but stored as a string on my `exercises` (rather than a `ObjectId`). This lets me relate `exercises` to `users`.

There were several routes we had to handle for this project: `GET /api/users` `POST /api/users`, `POST /api/users/:_id/exercises`, and `GET /api/users:id/logs`. Posting and getting a `user` was the more simple part of this project. Posting a `user` simply requires seeing if a username exists and if it does not, then submit the new user. There was no user story for duplicate `usernames`, so I could have skipped checking. Getting the list of all users, is a matter of simply using the `Model.find` on the `User` model created from the schema and returning the list.

Creating `exercises` and displaying the log of `exercises` for a `user` was more involved. I included validation for the information submitted when an exercise is being created. This was not part of the requirements for this project, but I felt it should be done. This meant checking if the required information was submitted, and in the correct format.

For submitting an `exercise` after checking if all submitted data is valid, I would then submit the `exercise` and return an object that was a combination of the `user` the `exercise` was for and the submitted `exercise` data.

Getting a log of exercises for a user had the requirements of accepting a `from`, `to`, and/or `limit` queries. These took a bit to figure out how to implement with `mongoose`/`mongodb`. Finally I figured out that I should have been storing my `dates` on `exercises` as actual `dates` and not `strings`. This would allow me to use `$gte` and `lte` as parameters on the `Model.find` method.

## File Metadata Microservice

This project should probably have come before the previous one, or just earlier in general. There was not a whole lot to it. freeCodeCamp recommends using the `multer` package to handle file uploads. `multer` adds a `body` object like `body-parser` does, as well as a `file` or `files` object to the `request` object in `express`.

Everything was already in place for the use of this package, I just had to add it in the `package.json` so `replit` would install it. The `multer` instructions says to not forget to include `multipart/form-data` as an `enctype` on our form. This led me to finding out there are different encryption types for forms. `multipart/form-data` is typically used when there is a file upload as part of a form, and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is generally used otherwise. `multer` also requires a name field on the `type="file"` `input` element.

Then getting the file details in `express` is as simple as handling the `POST` request from the form and using the `request` object to access the file's information through the `multer` provided `req.file.property`.

I figured this project was over too quickly so I spent some time looking into limiting the file upload size, as that is probably an important thing to have when dealing with uploaded files. `multer` provides a few options when you declare its `upload` variable. I added `{ limits: { fileSize: 1048576, fieldNameSize: 300 } }`, which limits file size to about `1MB` and the filename `300 bytes`.

It's also important to not include the `dest` / `storage` options for `multer` here, as that will write the files to the sever, and we don't want to do that at the moment, `replit` does limit the size of each virtual machine / project, so technically you could have files be written for a little while if you wanted. I decided this was probably not a good option, and leave out the `dest` / `storage` option so the file just stays in memory.

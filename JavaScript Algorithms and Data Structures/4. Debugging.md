## Introduction to the Debugging Challenges

These sections will go over debugging in JavaScript.

---

## Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

```JavaScript
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Add your code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
```

Both Chrome and Firefox have great JavaScript consoles, as well as many other DevTools.

One great way to help debug is by simply looking at the outputs, or values stored in variables with the `console.log()` method, which will "print" the the output of what's within the parentheses to the console.

---

## Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

```JavaScript
// Open your browser console
let outputTwo = "This will print to the browser console 2 times";
// Use console.log() to print the outputTwo variable
console.log(outputTwo);

let outputOne = "Try to get this to log only once to the browser console";
// Use console.clear() in the next line to print the outputOne only once
console.clear();

// Use console.log() to print the outputOne variable
console.log(outputOne);
```

---

## Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

```JavaScript
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Add your code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
```

The use of `typeof` can be helpful to check if a variable is correctly being set to the type of variable you think it is being set to.

For example if you are adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results may be unexpected.

---

## Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

```JavaScript
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);
```

One syntax-level issue that can arise is the misspelling of of a variable name, or any other spelling error.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = recievables - payable;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);
```

---

## Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

```JavaScript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current) =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);
```

Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3;
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);
```

---

## Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

```JavaScript
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
```

JavaScript allows the use of both single and double quotes to declare a string. Accidentally closing a string early due to the use of one of these in a string can lead to errors.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href="#Home">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
```

---

## Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

```JavaScript
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x === y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
```

Forgetting to include the second or third `=` when using the equality or strict equality operators can also lead to errors.

This error commonly comes up in `if` statements when you are trying to compare two variables in the condition of the `if` statement. (example using `if (x = y)` when you should use `if (x == y)`)

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x = y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
```

---

## Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call

```JavaScript
function getNine() {
  let x = 6;
  let y = 3;
  return x + y;
}

let result = getNine();
console.log(result);
```

When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
function getNine() {
  let x = 6;
  let y = 3;
  return x + y;
}

let result = getNine;
console.log(result);
```

---

## Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function

```JavaScript
function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(base, exp);
console.log(power);
```

It is important to pass variables to a function or method, that has required arguments, in the correct order.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(exp, base);
console.log(power);
```

---

## Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing

```JavaScript
function countToFive() {
  let firstFive = "12345";
  let len = firstFive.length;
  // Fix the line below
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  // Do not alter code below this line
    console.log(firstFive[i]);
  }
}

countToFive();
```
`Off by one errors` (OBOE) crop up when you're trying to target a specific index of a string or array, or when looping over the indices of them. JavaScript indexing starts at zero, and not one.

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
function countToFive() {
  let firstFive = "12345";
  let len = firstFive.length;
  // Fix the line below
  for (let i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
  // Do not alter code below this line
    console.log(firstFive[i]);
  }
}

countToFive();
```

---

## Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop

```JavaScript
function zeroArray(m, n) {
  // Creates a 2-D array with m rows and n columns of zeroes
  let newArray = [];
  let row = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    // Adds the m-th row into newArray
    
    row = [];
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
    // Pushes the current row, which now has n zeroes in it, to the array
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  return newArray;
}

let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);
```

Accidentally reinitializing a variable within a loop can become a potential issue as well. If you are using a variable that is controlling your loop inside of the loop itself, and it gets reinitialized on every loop, you could potentially end up with an infinite loop.

---

## Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

```JavaScript
function myFunc() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i += 2) {
    console.log("Still going!");
  }
}
```

Original code with error to correct:
```JavaScript
function myFunc() {
  for (let i = 1; i != 4; i += 2) {
    console.log("Still going!");
  }
}
```

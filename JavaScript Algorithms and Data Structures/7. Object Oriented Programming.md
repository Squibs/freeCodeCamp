## Introduction to the Object Oriented Programming Challenges

This section covers object oriented programming (oop) within JavaScript.

---

## Create a Basic JavaScript Object

```JavaScript
let dog = {
  name: 'Squibs',
  numLegs: 4,
};
```
`Objects` in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them `properties` and behavior just like their real-world counterparts.

---

## Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

```JavaScript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
```
`Dot notation` can be used in order to access the properties of an Object.

---

## Create a Method on an Object

```JavaScript
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs() { return `This dog has ${this.numLegs} legs.`; },
};

console.log(dog.sayLegs());
```
`Methods` are `properties` that are functions.

---

## Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword

```JavaScript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();
```

The use of the `this` keyword can avoid a pitfall where if the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated.

---

## Define a Constructor Function

```JavaScript
class Dog {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'name';
    this.color = 'color';
    this.numLegs = 4;
  }
}
```
`Constructors` are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object.

`Constructors` follow a few conventions:
- `Constructors` are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are nto `constructors`.
- `Constructors` use the keyword `this` to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the `constructor`, `this` refers tot he new object it will create.
- `Constructors` define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.

---

## Use a Constructor to Create Objects

```JavaScript
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Add your code below this line
const hound = new Dog();
```

The `new` operator is used when calling a constructor. This will tell JavaScript to create a new `instance` of an object. Without the `new` operator, `this` inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results.

---

## Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments

```JavaScript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.numLegs = 4;
  }
}

const terrier = new Dog('Terry Bredmun', 'Grey');
```

You can set up constructors to accept several parameters, so that when a new `instance` of an object is created it can be set up to create variations of an object, rather than having each `instance` of an object be the same.

---

## Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof

```JavaScript
function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

// Add your code below this line
const myHouse = new House(3);
console.log(myHouse instanceof House);
```

JavaScript has a convenient way to verify that an `instance` of an object is in fact an instance of an object. The `instanceof` operator allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning `true` or `false` based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor.

---

## Understand Own Properties

```JavaScript
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Add your code below this line
for (let property in canary) {
  if (canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}
```

In the following example, the `Bird` constructor defines two properties: `name` and `numLegs`:

```JavaScript
function bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird('Donald');
let canary = new Bird('Tweety');
```
`name` and `numLegs` are called `own` properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that `duck` and `canary` each has its own separate copy of these properties.

In fact every instance of `Bird` will have its own copy of these properties.

The following code adds all of the `own` properties of `duck` to the array `ownProps`:

```JavaScript
let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if (duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps); // prints [ 'name', 'numLegs' ]
```

---

## Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

// Add your code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
```

When you know every `instance` of an object will need to have the same property with the same value applied, a better way to accomplish adding this property rather than through the constructor is through an object's `prototype`. The `prototype` is an object that is shared among ALL instances of an object.

Setting a property to the prototype of a class shares that property with all instances of a class instead of each instance of a class having their own property. For example in the above all dogs will have numLegs = 4 shared, instead of each instance of dog, for example beagle (above), having their own numLegs.

---

## Iterate Over All Properties

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Add your code below this line 
for (let property in beagle) {
  if (beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
console.log(prototypeProps);
```

You have now seen two kinds of properties: `own` properties and `prototype` properties. `Own` properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And `prototype` properties are defined on the `prototype`.

An important thing to know is how to iterate over all the properties of an object. Here is how you add `duck's` `own` properties to the array `ownProps` and `prototype` properties to the array `prototypeProps`:

```JavaScript
let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if (duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}
```

---

## Understand the Constructor Property

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add your code below this line
function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Dog) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

Objects have a hidden `constructor` property located on the object instances. The `constructor` property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance.

The advantage of the `constructor` property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. Here's an example of how this could be used:

```JavaScript
function joinBirdFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Bird) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Note**:

Since the `constructor` property can be overwritten, it's generally better to use the `instanceof` method to check the type of an object.

---

## Change the Prototype to a New Object

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

Dog.prototype = {
  // Add your code below this line
  numLegs: 4,
  eat() { return 'crunch crunch'; },
  describe() { return 'I\'m such a pretty dog!'; },
};
```

A more efficient way to add properties to the `prototype` is to set the `prototype` to a new object that already contains the properties. This way, the properties are added all at once.

---

## Remember to Set the Constructor Property when Changing the Prototype

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

// Modify the code below this line
Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog, // define the constructor property
  numLegs: 2, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom"); 
  }, 
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name); 
  }
};
```

There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the `prototype` to a new object. It erased the `constructor` property. In order to fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the `constructor` property.

---

## Understand Where an Object’s Prototype Comes From

```JavaScript

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Add your code below this line
console.log(Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle));
```

Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its `prototype` directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the `Bird` constructor creates the `duck` object:

```JavaScript
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let duck = new Bird('Donald');
```
`duck` inherits its `prototype` from the `Bird` constructor function. You can show this relationship with the `isPrototypeOf` method:

```JavaScript
Bird.prototype.isPrototypeOf(duck);
// returns true
```

---

## Understand the Prototype Chain

```JavaScript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // => true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
```

All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a `prototype`. Also, an object's `prototype` itself is an object. 

Because a `prototype` is an object, a `prototype` can have its own `prototype`...

From a previous challenge:

```JavaScript
let duck = new Bird('Donald');
duck.hasOwnProperty('name'); // => true
```

The `hasOwnProperty` method is defined in `Object.prototype`, which can be accessed by `Bird.prototype`, which can then be accessed by `duck`. This is an example of the `prototype chain`.

In this `prototype` chain, `Bird` is the `supertype` for `duck`, while `duck` is the `subtype`. `Object` is a `supertype` for both `Bird` and `duck`.

`Object` is a `supertype` for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the `hasOwnProperty` method.

---

## Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself

```JavaScript
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat, 
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear, 
};

function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat() { return 'nom nom nom'; },
};
```

There's a principle in programming called `Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)`. The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change, requires fixing code in multiple places. This means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

In the following example, the `describe` method is shared by both `Bird` and `Dog`:

```JavaScript
Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
```

The `describe` method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the `DRY` principle by created a `supertype` (or parent) called `Animal`:

```JavaScript
function Animal() { };

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  describe: function() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
};
```

Since `Animal` includes the `describe` method, you can remove it from `Bird` and `Dog`:

```JavaScript
Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
};
```

---

## Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype

```JavaScript
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Add your code below this line

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line

duck.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom" 
```

This and the next challenge will cover how to reuse `Animal's` methods like `Bird` and `Dog` without defining them again. It uses a technique called `inheritance`.

This challenge covers the first step, which is to make an instance of the `supertype` (or parent).

One way to create an instance of an object is using the `new` operator:

```JavaScript
let animal = new Animal();
```

There are disadvantages to using this syntax for `inheritance`, which are too complex for the scope of this challenge. For now, this is an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

```JavaScript
let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```

`Object.create(obj)` creates a new object, and sets `obj` as the new object's `prototype`. Recall that the `prototype` is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the `prototype` of `animal` to be `Animal's` `prototype`, you are effectively giving the `animal` the same "recipe" as any other instance of `animal`.

```JavaScript
animal.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
animal instanceof Animal; // => true
```

---

## Set the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent

```JavaScript
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

function Dog() { }

// Add your code below this line
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

let beagle = new Dog();
beagle.eat();  // Should print "nom nom nom"
```

The next step for inheriting behavior is to set the `prototype` of the `subtype` (or child) to be an instance of `Animal`.

```JavaScript
let duck = new Bird('Donald');
duck.eat(); // prints 'nom nom nom'
```

`duck` inherits all of `Animal`'s properties, including the `eat` method.

---

## Reset an Inherited Constructor Property

```JavaScript
function Animal() { }
function Bird() { }
function Dog() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Add your code below this line
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();
```

When an object inherits its `prototype` from another object, it also inherits the `supertype`'s constructor property.

---

## Add Methods After Inheritance

```JavaScript
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log("nom nom nom"); };

function Dog() { }

// Add your code below this line

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
Dog.prototype.bark = function () { console.log('Woof!'); };

// Add your code above this line

let beagle = new Dog();

beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.bark(); // Should print "Woof!"
```

A constructor function that inherits its `prototype` object from a `supertype` constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

---

## Override Inherited Methods

```JavaScript
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Add your code below this line

Penguin.prototype.fly = function() { return 'Alas, this is a flightless bird.'; };

// Add your code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
```

It is possible to override an inherited method. It's done by adding a method to `ChildObject.prototype` using the same method name as the one to override.

---

## Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects

```JavaScript
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};

// Add your code below this line
const glideMixin = function (obj) {
  obj.glide = function () {
    console.log('I\'m Glidin\'');
  };
};

glideMixin(bird);
glideMixin(boat);
```

As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like `Bird` and `Airplane`. They can both fly, but a `Bird` is not a type of `Airplane` and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, it is better to use `mixins`. A `mixin` allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

---

## Use Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally

```JavaScript
function Bird() {
  const weight = 15;
  this.getWeight = function () {
    return weight;
  }; 
}
```

In the previous challenge, `bird` had a public property `name`. It is considered public because it can be accessed anc hanged outside of `bird`'s definition.

The simplest way to make properties private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the property can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.

---

## Understand the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

```JavaScript
(function () {
  console.log("A cozy nest is ready");
})();
```

A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared.

The following parentheses `()` cause the function to be immediately invoked. A nameless (anonymous) function that is immediately invoked is called a `Immediately Invoked Function Expression` or `IIFE`.

---

## Use an IIFE to Create a Module

```JavaScript
const funModule = (function () {
  return {
    isCuteMixin(obj) {
      obj.isCute = function () {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin(obj) {
      obj.sing = function () {
        console.log('Singing to an awesome tune');
      };
    }
  };
}) ();
```

An `IIFE` is often used to group related functionality into a single object or `module`. For example, an earlier challenge defined two mixins:

```JavaScript
function glideMixin(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
    console.log("Gliding on the water");
  };
}
function flyMixin(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  };
}
```

We can group these `mixins` into a module as follows:

```JavaScript
let motionModule = (function () {
  return {
    glideMixin: function (obj) {
      obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding on the water");
      };
    },
    flyMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
      };
    }
  }
}) (); // The two parentheses cause the function to be immediately invoked
```

Note that you have an `IIFE` that returns an object `motionModule`. This returned object contains all of the `mixin` behaviors as properties of the object.

The advantage of the `module` pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code. Here is an example using it:

```JavaScript
motionModule.glideMixin(duck);
duck.glide();
```

## Introduction to the ES6 Challenges

This section will go over ES6 and the following features:
- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Modules
- Promises
- Generators
- `let` and `const`

---

## Explore Problems with the var Keyword

```JavaScript
'use strict';
let redNosedReindeer = "Rudolph";
let favorite = redNosedReindeer + " is Santa's favorite reindeer.";
```
When using the `var` keyword you run into the issue of being able to overwrite declarations without an error.

```JavaScript
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
```

In the above example the `camper` variable is decalred as `James` and then overriden to be `David`.

A new keyword called `let` was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the `var` keyword.

If you were to replace `var` with `let` in the variable declarations of the example above, the result would be an error.

---

## Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

```JavaScript
let catName;
let quote;

const catTalk = function () {
  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";
};

catTalk();
```

---

## Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords

```JavaScript
'use strict';
function checkScope() {
  let i = "function scope";
  if (true) {
    let i = "block scope";
    console.log("Block scope i is: ", i);
  }
  console.log("Function scope i is: ", i);
  return i;
}
// only change the code above this line
checkScope();
```
When a variable is declared with the `var` keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The `let` keyword is similar, but with a few extra features. When a variable is decalred with `let` inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

---

## Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

```JavaScript
function printManyTimes(str) {
  "use strict";

  // change code below this line

  const SENTENCE = str + " is cool!";
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i+=2) {
    console.log(str);
  }

  // change code above this line

}
printManyTimes("FreeCodeCamp");
```

OLD SOLUTION:
```JavaScript
'use strict';
// change 'var' to 'let' or 'const'
// rename constant variables
const pi = 3.14;
const radius = 10;
const calculateCircumference = function(r) {
  const diameter = 2 * r;
  const result = pi * diameter;
  return result;
};
// Test your code
console.log(calculateCircumference(radius));
```
`const` is another keyword that can be used to declare variables in ES6.

`const` has all the same features that `let` has, but variables declared using `const` are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with `const`, it cannot be reassigned.

A common practice is to name your constants in all upper-case and with an uderscore to separate words (e.g. `EXAMPLE_VARIABLE`).

---

## Mutate an Array Declared with const

```JavaScript
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line

  // s = [2, 5, 7]; <- this is invalid
  s[0] = 2;
  s[1] = 5;
  s[2] = 7;

  // change code above this line
}
editInPlace();
```

OLD SOLUTION:
```JavaScript
'use strict';
const s = [ 5, 7, 2 ];
// change code below this line
s[0] = 2;
s[1] = 5;
s[2] = 7;
// change code above this line
// Test your code
console.log(s);
```
It is important to note that objects (including arrays and fuctions) are still mutable even when they are declared using `const`. The use of `const`, in this case, only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

---

## Prevent Object Mutation

```JavaScript
function freezeObj() {
  "use strict";
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
  // change code below this line

  Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  // change code above this line
  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch( ex ) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}

const PI = freezeObj();
```
To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function `Object.freeze` to prevent data mutation.

When an object is freezed, you can no longer add/update/delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected **without** any error.

---

## Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

```JavaScript
'use strict';
// change code below this line
const magic = () => new Date();
// change code above this line
// test your code
console.log(magic());
```
We often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

The following syntax can achieve this:

```JavaScript
const myFunc = function () {
  const myVar = 'value';
  retrun myVar;
}
```

ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead the `arrow function syntax` can be used:

```JavaScript
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = 'value';
  return myVar;
}
```

It is possible to shorten this even futher when there is no function body.

```JavaScript
const myFunc  = () => 'value';
```

---

## Write Arrow Functions with Parameters

```JavaScript
'use strict';
// change code below this line
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);
// change code above this line
// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
```

---

## Write Higher Order Arrow Functions

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34];
// change code below this line
const squaredIntegers = realNumberArray.filter((value) => Number.isInteger(value)).map((value) => value * value);
// change code above this line
// test your code
console.log(squaredIntegers);
```
Arrow functinos work well with higher order functions, such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, that take other functions as arguments for processing collections of data.

---

## Set Default Parameters for Your Functions

```JavaScript
'use strict';
function increment(number, value = 1) {
    return number + value;
}
console.log(increment(5, 2)); // returns 7
console.log(increment(5)); // returns 6
```
ES6 introduces *`default parameters`* for functions in order to create more flexible functions.

*Learned about default parameters for functions; why wasn't this taught to me way earlier? Setting an accepted argument to a value will set that variable's default value. I can skip checking for undefined values with this and just set defaults if I want the function to run regardless.*

---

## Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters

```JavaScript
'use strict';
function sum(...args) {
    const array = args;
    return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
```
ES6 introduces the *`rest operator`* for function parameters. With the rest operator, you can make functions that take variable number of arguments. These arguments get stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

---

## Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
const arr2 = [...arr1]; // change this line
arr1.push('JUN');
console.log(arr2); // arr2 should not be affected
```
Using the `spread operator` outside of a function's arguments. I already knew I could do something like `const fName = funciton (...args) {};` but this has shown that you can use it in other ways. The above example is one, while another example would be:

```JavaScript
const addThreeNumbers = function (x, y, z) {
  console.log(x + y + z);
}
const args = [0, 1, 2, 3];
addThreeNumbers(...args);
```

This will use `x = 0, y = 1` and `z = 2`, which will log 3. This is the opposite of how I am currently used to using the `spread operator`.

---

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects

```JavaScript
function getLength(str) {
  "use strict";

  // change code below this line
  const { length : len } = str;
  // change code above this line

  return len; // you must assign length to len in line

}

console.log(getLength('FreeCodeCamp'));
```
As an explanation of what is happening here, since this took me a bit to figure out, going through this once again as a refresher.

`const { length : len } = str;`

In this line we are declaring a `constant` variable called `len` with the value of the length of the passed argument `str`. 

So `{ length : len } = str` is essentially `len = str.length`. The use of `length` here is what is causing a bit of confusion in this example, as you are trying to get the length of the passed string and store that in a variable called `len` using *`destructuring assignment`*.

The use of freeCodeCamp's editor helped me understand what was happening as the syntax highlighting has `length` as a separate color (because in this case, I am using 'length' as a property of 'String').

![freeCodeCamp Syntax Highlighting for this solution](http://res.cloudinary.com/squibs/image/upload/v1516829195/freeCodeCamp%20Markdown%20Notes/Syntax_Highlight_example.png)


OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const greeting = 'itadakimasu';
// change code below this line
const {length} = greeting; // change this
// change code above this line
console.log(length); // should be using destructuring
```
This is another interesting section that taught me something new using the `destructuring assignment`. While this solution is one way of using it, the description given along with this challenge provides a better example:

```JavaScript
const voxel = { x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };
const { x, y, z } = voxel; // x = 3.6, y = 7.4, z = 6.54 

// voxel.x into a, voxel.y into b, voxel.z into c
const { x: a, y: b, z: c }; // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54
```

---

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

```JavaScript
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  today: { min: 72, max: 83 },
  tomorrow: { min: 73.3, max: 84.6 }
};

function getMaxOfTmrw(forecast) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  
  const { tomorrow : { max : maxOfTomorrow } } = forecast;

  // change code above this line
  return maxOfTomorrow;
}

console.log(getMaxOfTmrw(LOCAL_FORECAST)); // should be 84.6
```
Again in this solution it is essentially assigning `forecast.tomorrow.max` to `maxOfTomorrow`.


OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const forecast = {
  today: { min: 72, max: 83 },
  tomorrow: { min: 73.3, max: 84.6 }
};
// change code below this line
const { tomorrow : { max: maxOfTomorrow }} = forecast; // change this line
// change code above this line
console.log(maxOfTomorrow); // should be 84.6
```
Similar to the previous challenge this one showed another way to use the `destructuring assignment` on nested objects.

---

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

```JavaScript
let a = 8, b = 6;

(() => {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  
  [a, b] = [b, a];
  
  // change code above this line
})();

console.log(a); // should be 6
console.log(b); // should be 8
```

OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
let a = 8, b = 6;
// change code below this line
[a, b] = [b, a];
// change code above this line
console.log(a); // should be 6
console.log(b); // should be 8
```
This shows a way to use the `destructuring assignment` to swap values of two variables. Further examples included in this one are:

```JavaScript
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
```

```JavaScript
const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 5 
```

---

## Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Operator to Reassign Array Elements

```JavaScript
const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  
  const [a, b, ...arr] = list; // [,, ...arr] = list would also work

  // change code below this line
  return arr;
}
const arr = removeFirstTwo(source);
console.log(arr); // should be [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
console.log(source); // should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
```
I would write this in the same way as my old solution below `const [,, ...arr] = list;`, however you need to put the `a` and `b` variables in, in-order to pass the "destructuring was used" check that freeCodeCamp does.


OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
// change code below this line
const [,, ...arr] = source; // change this
// change code below this line
console.log(arr); // should be [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
console.log(source); // should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
```

---

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

```JavaScript
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};
const half = (function() {
  "use strict"; // do not change this line

  // change code below this line
  return function half({ max, min }) {
    // use function argument destructuring
    return (max + min) / 2.0;
  };
  // change code above this line

})();
console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015
```

OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};
// change code below this line

const half = ({max, min}) => ((max + min) / 2.0); // use function argument destructuring

// change code above this line
console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015
```
This challenge was interesting. Using destructuring as a function's parameters allows for easy working with objects. This makes me wonder if the same can be used for arrays (I mean it probably can, but a good example of using it would be great).

---

## Create Strings using Template Literals

```JavaScript
const result = {
  success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
  failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
  skipped: ["id-blacklist", "no-dup-keys"]
};

function makeList(arr) {
  "use strict";

  // change code below this line
  
  const resultDisplayArray = arr.map(entry => `<li class="text-warning">${entry}</li>`);
  
  // change code above this line

  return resultDisplayArray;
}

/**
 * makeList(result.failure) should return:
 * [ <li class="text-warning">no-var</li>,
 *   <li class="text-warning">var-on-top</li>, 
 *   <li class="text-warning">linebreak</li> ]
 **/

const resultDisplayArray = makeList(result.failure);
```
Redoing this challenge now, I realize that my old solution could have been done better. Rather than repeating what I wrote, I could have just itterated through the passed array and applied the HTML markup to each string in order to create the list.

OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const result = {
  success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
  failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
  skipped: ["id-blacklist", "no-dup-keys"]
};
// change code below this line
const li = '<li class="text-warning">';
const resultDisplay = `${li}${result.failure[0]}</li>\n${li}${result.failure[1]}</li>\n${li}${result.failure[2]}</li>`;
// change code above this line
console.log(resultDisplay);
/**
 * should look like this:
 * <li class="text-warning">no-var</li>
 * <li class="text-warning">var-on-top</li>
 * <li class="text-warning">linebreak</li>
 **/
```
ES6 introduced *`template literals`*, which removes the need to concatenate with the `+` operator anymore.

---

## Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Simple Fields

```JavaScript
const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  
  return ({
    name,
    age,
    gender
  });
  
  // change code above this line
};

console.log(createPerson("Zodiac Hasbro", 56, "male")); // returns a proper object
```

OLD SOLUTION:

```JavaScript
'use strict';
// change code below this line
const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => ({name, age, gender});
// change code above this line
console.log(createPerson("Zodiac Hasbro", 56, "male")); // returns a proper object
```
This one is pretty interesting as well. ES6 converts `({ name, age, gender })` to `({ name: name, age: age, gendger: gender })` automatically. So instead of writing something like:

```JavaScript
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
});
```

You can write it like:

```JavaScript
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
```

---

## Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6

```JavaScript
'use strict';
// change code below this line

const bicycle = {
  gear: 2,
  setGear (newGear) {
    this.gear = newGear;
  }
};

// change code above this line
bicycle.setGear(3);
console.log(bicycle.gear);
```
This example shows how to put functions inside of objects with ES6. Previously in ES5 you had to do:

```JavaScript
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

Now you can do it as:

```JavaScript
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

---

## Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

```JavaScript
'use strict';
/* Alter code below this line */

class Vegetable {
  constructor(veggyName) {
    this.name = veggyName;
  }
}

/* Alter code above this line */
const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
console.log(carrot.name); // => should be 'carrot'
```
ES6 provides a new syntax to help create objects, using the keyword *`class`*.

The `class` syntax is just a syntax, and not a full-fledged class based implementation of object oriented paradigm, unlike in languages like Java, Python, or Ruby.

In ES5, we usually define a constructor function, and use the `new` keyword to instantiate an object:

```JavaScript
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet) {
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}

var zeus = new spaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

This `class` syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:

```JavaScript
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}

const zeus = new spaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

---

## Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object

```JavaScript
'use strict';
/* Alter code below this line */
class Thermostat {
  constructor(tempInFahrenheit) {
    this.fahrenheit = tempInFahrenheit;
  }

  get temperature() {
    return (this.fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0;
  }

  set temperature(updatedTempInFahrenheit) {
    this.fahrenheit = (updatedTempInFahrenheit * 9.0) / 5.0 + 32;
  }
}
/* Alter code above this line */
const thermos = new Thermostat(76); // setting in Farenheit scale
let temp = thermos.temperature; // 24.44 in C
thermos.temperature = 26;
temp = thermos.temperature; // 26 in C
console.log(temp);
```
You can obtain values from an object, and set a value of a property within an object.

These are classically called *`getters`* and *`setters`*.

---

## Understand the Differences Between import and require

```JavaScript
import { capitalizeString } from "string_functions";
capitalizeString("hello!");
```
`require()` imports everything from a file; while `import` will only import the specified funciton / variable.

---

## Use export to Reuse a Code Block

```JavaScript
export const foo = "bar";
export const boo = "far";
```
The following is what is refered to as *`named export`*. With this, we can import an code we export into another file with the `import` syntax from the last lesson.

```JavaScript
const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}

export { capitalizeString } // how to export functions
export const foo = "bar"; // how to export variables
```

You can also compact all the export statements into one line:

```JavaScript
const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}

const foo = "bar";
export { capitalizeString, foo }
```

---

## Use * to Import Everything from a File

```JavaScript
import * as myStringModule from "capitalize_strings";
myStringModule.capitalize("foo");
myStringModule.lowercase("Foo");
```
If you wish to import all the contents of a file, this can be done with the *`import *`* syntax.

---

## Create an Export Fallback with export default

```JavaScript
export default function subtract (x,y) { return x - y; }
export default const subtract = (x,y) => {return x - y;}
```
The first one is what I believe the answer should be, the second one is the actual solution given. The second one throws a default JavaScript error for me `expected expression`. The MDN lists this as an example:

```JavaScript
export default function cube(x) {
  return x * x * x;
}
```

Which matches what I believe is the correct solution.

<strong>Challenge was not working properly when I did this.</strong>

---

## Import a Default Export

```JavaScript
import subtract from "math_functions";
subtract(7,4);
```

# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Click any of the links below to view my notes and answers I came up with while going through the <em>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</em> challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp.

There were no projects for this section as it was focused teaching the basics of JavaScript more-so than anything else. Check out my [JavaScript References](https://github.com/Squibs/Beta-freeCodeCamp/blob/master/JavaScript%20References.md#javascript-references) I have thrown together from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (W3S) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN). I tried to take the best from both sites and combine them into a single page of references.

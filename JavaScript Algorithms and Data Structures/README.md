# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Click any of the links below to view my notes and answers I came up with while going through the _JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures_ challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp.

Check out my [JavaScript References](/JavaScript%20References.md#javascript-references) I have thrown together from various sources such as [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (W3S). I tried to take the best from both sites and combine them into a single page of JavaScript references.

**View my [_JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects_](./10.%20JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects.md#javascript-alorithms-and-data-structures-projects)** most importantly for this section. It contains all the projects relevant to this section and is where I am able to show what I have learned by going through the lessons and challenges in this section.

- [ES6](./2.%20ES6.md#es6)
- [Regular Expressions](./3.%20Regular%20Expressions.md#regular-expressions)
- [Debugging](./4.%20Debugging.md#debugging)

I also have some legacy files and notes related to this section; in which I wanted to keep to be able to look back on:

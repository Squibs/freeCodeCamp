## Introduction to Nano

Nano is a program for editing files that run in the terminal. You can open a file with `nano filename`.

Lists of commands are listed at the bottom. `^LETTER` means to use `ctrl + LETTER`.

- Save with `^O` write out.
- Exit with `^X`.
- Cut with `^K`, removes whole line.
- `^U` to 'uncut'.

The `M` at the beginning of other commands at the bottom stand for 'meta'. It's a key that doesn't exist on most keyboards. If on OSX it means press `escape`. If on another system press `ALT` then the letter.

## Final Code

```sh
echo "
Welcome to my castle
"

echo "
 /\                /\ 
/  \              /  \

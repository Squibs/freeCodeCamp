## Build a Random Quote Machine

### [Quote Machine](https://squibs.github.io/quote-machine/) (Click to view functional site)

*Completed April 19, 2018* - [View the project files on GitHub.](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine)

This is a project in which I have started and completed three times on my path to learning web development. My first time going through this project was originally created as an *Intermediate Front End Development Project* for freeCodeCamp. That version of this project can be seen in the screenshot here:

*Completed June 1, 2017* - [View this version of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/before-react)

( [View a functional site of this version of my project on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Sulph/full/mMxJLv/) )



I later redid the project when I initially went through the *Front End Libraries Projects* on the beta of freeCodeCamp as a project to learn React. The React version of this project that does **NOT** utilize Redux can be seen in the screenshot here:

*Completed August 22, 2017* - [View this version of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/previous-react)

( *No functional site is available for this version, as it is very similar to my newest version.* )

I have now redone the project yet again (**View the very first screenshot**), this time using React as well as Redux after a small break to touch up on what I had previously learned about React.

Before starting this project, for the third time, I delved into Webpack 4 to learn exactly what that was doing for me, and so that I knew exactly what was going on in the background instead of using the create-react-app repository. I created two boilerplates while learning Webpack. The [first one](https://github.com/Squibs/static-site-boilerplate) is a boilerplate for static websites, which I created after doing my first paid freelance project. The [second boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate) is what I created after taking Stephen Grider's **Modern React with Redux** course on *Udemy*. It is a boilerplate for React/Redux projects, that I plan to adapt for myself as I do more React projects.

As I redid the React version of this project, I wanted to keep the same look I created the second time through this project, and just focus on the React/Redux side of things to really figure out what I am doing. I mostly feel as though I have learned quite a lot about Webpack, and still have a lot to learn about React and Redux. That knowledge will come as I continue to do more of the projects on the beta of freeCodeCamp.

## Build a Markdown Previewer

*Completed April 23, 2018* - [View the project files on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/markdown-previewer)

It's beginning to look like many of these first few React projects are going to end up having a simplistic design. I feel freeCodeCamp wants more focus on what is happening with React (and Redux). There was not a whole lot to spice up on this project aesthetic-wise, so I kept it simple again (coming from the a re-make of my quote-machine project).

The markdown here is being parsed and compiled into html by [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). The syntax highlighting for `<code>` blocks is handled using [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). By default Prism.js only loads `markup`, `css`, `clike`, and `javascript`. While there is an option to load more languages, I have decided to leave only these defaults, as I do not see myself using this project for much more than for demonstration purposes.

This is the second project in which have used my own [Webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate), and so far I have not run across too many issues, if any at all. I feel quite happy that I took the time to learn Webpack before getting into these projects, as it has really helped me understand exactly what is going on when working with Webpack.

## Build a JavaScript Calculator

### [JavaScript Calculator](https://squibs.github.io/js-calculator/) (Click to view functional site)

<em>Completed August 1, 2017</em>

The first advanced advanced front end development project I have completed on freeCodeCamp. For this project I was tasked with creating a calculator that can perform simple functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divde) on two numbers. The ability to clear all inputs, and the ability to chain mathematical operations together until the equal button is pressed. I decided to do just this, however expand on it just a bit.

I have put in the ability to delete previously entered values to allow for anything entered to be changed. I put in the ability to switch mathmatical operations as soon as one is entered, without having to use the backspace. I made the calculator automatically enter in zeros at appropriate times, such as when typing in a decimal such as 0.5. I also even decided to give the calculator a bit of scientific value and gave it order of operations.

This project definitely can be expanded greatly and in the future I might just decide to expand on it. Overall I am quite happy with what I have created for this project and feel as though I have met the required "user stories" and more.

## Build a Pomodoro Clock

### [Pomodoro Clock](https://squibs.github.io/pomodoro-clock/) (Click to view functional site)

<em>Completed August 3, 2017</em>

A [pomodoro clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) I created while going through the advanced front end development projects on freeCodeCamp. This project had the requirements of being able to start a 25 minute pomodoro timer that would go off after 25 minutes had elapsed, the ability to reset the timer, and the ability to customize the length of the pomodoro timer.

I decided to use [JavaScript classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for this project. At first I was struggling to figure out exactly how to accomplish this. However after many tutorials and a lot of struggling, I came up with what this project is now. I have a Pomodoro class that has several methods to accomplish everything for this project. I'm still not quite sure I used the class identifier / object-oriented programming in a correct manner.

I included the ability to adjust the focus and rest time lengths; as well as the ability to start, pause, resume and reset the timer as it counts down. I decided to also include a volume slider to control the the volume of the alarms / alerts that go off once the timer reaches the end of the focus or rest periods respectively.

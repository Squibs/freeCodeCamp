## Build a Random Quote Machine

### [Quote Machine](https://squibs.github.io/quote-machine/) (Click to view functional site)

*Completed April 19, 2018* - [View the project files on GitHub.](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine)

This is a project in which I have started and completed three times on my path to learning web development. My first time going through this project was originally created as an *Intermediate Front End Development Project* for freeCodeCamp. That version of this project can be seen in the screenshot here:

*Completed June 1, 2017* - [View this version of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/before-react)

( [View a functional site of this version of my project on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Sulph/full/mMxJLv/) )



I later redid the project when I initially went through the *Front End Libraries Projects* on the beta of freeCodeCamp as a project to learn React. The React version of this project that does **NOT** utilize Redux can be seen in the screenshot here:

*Completed August 22, 2017* - [View this version of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/previous-react)

( *No functional site is available for this version, as it is very similar to my newest version.* )

I have now redone the project yet again (**View the very first screenshot**), this time using React as well as Redux after a small break to touch up on what I had previously learned about React.

Before starting this project, for the third time, I delved into Webpack 4 to learn exactly what that was doing for me, and so that I knew exactly what was going on in the background instead of using the create-react-app repository. I created two boilerplates while learning Webpack. The [first one](https://github.com/Squibs/static-site-boilerplate) is a boilerplate for static websites, which I created after doing my first paid freelance project. The [second boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate) is what I created after taking Stephen Grider's **Modern React with Redux** course on *Udemy*. It is a boilerplate for React/Redux projects, that I plan to adapt for myself as I do more React projects.

As I redid the React version of this project, I wanted to keep the same look I created the second time through this project, and just focus on the React/Redux side of things to really figure out what I am doing. I mostly feel as though I have learned quite a lot about Webpack, and still have a lot to learn about React and Redux. That knowledge will come as I continue to do more of the projects on the beta of freeCodeCamp.

## Build a Markdown Previewer

*Completed April 23, 2018* - [View the project files on GitHub](https://github.com/Squibs/markdown-previewer)

It's beginning to look like many of these first few React projects are going to end up having a simplistic design. I feel freeCodeCamp wants more focus on what is happening with React (and Redux). There was not a whole lot to spice up on this project aesthetic-wise, so I kept it simple again (coming from the a re-make of my quote-machine project).

The markdown here is being parsed and compiled into html by [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). The syntax highlighting for `<code>` blocks is handled using [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). By default Prism.js only loads `markup`, `css`, `clike`, and `javascript`. While there is an option to load more languages, I have decided to leave only these defaults, as I do not see myself using this project for much more than for demonstration purposes.

This is the second project in which have used my own [Webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/Squibs/react-redux-boilerplate), and so far I have not run across too many issues, if any at all. I feel quite happy that I took the time to learn Webpack before getting into these projects, as it has really helped me understand exactly what is going on when working with Webpack.

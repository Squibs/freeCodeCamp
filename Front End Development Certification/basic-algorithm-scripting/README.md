### Basic Algorithms

<em>Completed May 27, 2017</em>

This was a series of challenges in which I had to create basic functions (algorithms) to convert passed information to the function into the correct result. The challenge of this series of lessons was to figure out my own way through each algorithm and achieve the correct result, while also trying not to stumble upon a solution and ruin the learning experience. I was able to do this for most of it, with a couple mistakes of reading too far and ruining the solution for myself. I would say any of the solutions I finished with can be optimized much further or made simpler; I however, am happy with what I have done with each of these algorithms and look forward to learning how I could have optimized them in the future.

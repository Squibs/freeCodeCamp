### [Cat Photo App](https://codepen.io/Sulph/pen/qmPGwq) (Responsive Design with Bootstrap) (Click to view functional site on Code-Pen)

<em>Completed May 03, 2017</em>

Simple starting project. Many things were changed throughout the creation of this; lines were deleted or replaced multiple times. Teachings of responsive design were made as well as the basic foundations of html, css, and bootstrap were taught in this lesson/project. This was made to fit the size of a fairly small screen-sized phone. Best viewed at lower resolutions; all content scales with size, using the portrait-based editor layout on codepen.io will allow the use of a slider to see how the content reacts when space is lowered.

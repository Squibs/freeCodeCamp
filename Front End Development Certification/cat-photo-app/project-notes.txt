Keywords: BootStrap (responsive design), CSS, 

CSS & CSS Classes
	classes start with '.' eg(.thick-green-border {})
		apply classes to pretty much any other declared element eg(<div class="thick-green-border">)
	use # to stylize IDs eg(#thick-green-border {})
	styles are read from top to bottom; stylings declared after previous ones will take precedence
		(div class="brown-font blue-font") whichever class was declared second will take precedence
	in-line styles will take precedence over CSS classes and stylings at top
	SUMMARY OF PRECEDENCE: Body Element < CSS Class < Order of CSS Classes < ID stylings < in-line styles < !important
	!important will take precedence over everything
	padding, margins, borders
		padding is space between element and border
		margin is space between border and other elements / edges
		border is space between padding and margins
	
Uses BootStrap to allow for screen scaling of various elements. 
	Everything is scaling for small web phones atm.
	bootstrap classes eg(text-primary, text-center, text-danger)
		centering, colors
	fluid container (overall containing div with class container-fluid)
	bootstrap grid (rows with up to 12 columns) ".col-xs-*"

Uses Font Awesome Icons to put icons within buttons.
	can scale icons just like text

Hexadecimal Colors and RGB colors
	Both can create the same amount of colors:
	#000000 
		(0-9, A-F)
		follows RGB; two for each eg(00.00.00)
		0 is the lowest while F is the highest
	RGB(0, 0, 0);
		numbers rather than hexadecimal; otherwise the same

HTML Form for user input

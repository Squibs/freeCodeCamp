### Object Oriented and Functional Programming

<em>Completed May 24, 2017</em>

This was a small series of lessons that featured:
- Compact amount of object-oriented programming "philosophy".
- Differences between constructors and objects.
- Many useful array methods.

I learned quite a bit about object-oriented programming previously, before I started learning from freeCodeCamp. Much of this section of lessons was just a refresher for me. View my notes on this section for what I found to be useful.

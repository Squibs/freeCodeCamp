### [jQuery Playground](https://codepen.io/Sulph/pen/aWEyaK) (Click to view functional site on Code-Pen)

<em>Completed May 04, 2017</em>

A playground used in several freeCodeCamp challenges teaching about how to use various jQuery commands. While this is not very much of a project to show off, I believe it is a good thing to recognize a simple project that allows you to test the many functions of jQuery. View project-notes.txt for notes on various commands that can be used with this.

### Basic Javascript

<em>Completed May 23, 2017</em>

This was a series of many lessons relating to:
- Arrays and a few methods to retrieve or store from the front or back of the array.
- Regular Expressions.
- Creating random numbers in various ranges with Math.random();
- JSON objects.
- Various further uses out of if-statements and operators.

View the "Random JavaScript examples I learned something from:" at the end of my notes to see various created functions from these lessons that I myself found to be useful or ended up teaching me something of value.

*Completed June 20, 2017*

For this project I was tasked with creating a technical documentation page. I decided to recreate the manual that came with my AMD Ryzen CPU. The navigation contains each heading in order to quickly get to any section.

freeCodeCamp had several user stories, which included using tables, code, and other various html elements in order to create this project.

*Completed June 16, 2017*

This is the first project in the now redesigned Responsive Web Design curriculum on freeCodeCamp. Originally this was my second project I created. This is what I had to say about the project at the time:

> This is the second *Responsive Web Design Project* on freeCodeCamp. This project was mostly about working with forms.  I decided to do a two-column layout for my forum with the labels on the left and the input fields on the right.
>
>The page does not handle any information submitted as freeCodeCamp did not go over how one would handle this at the time in which I created this.

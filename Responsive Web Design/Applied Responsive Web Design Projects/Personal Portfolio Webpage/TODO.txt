TODO:

Section and Article tags

Re-write ABOUT content. Most of what is there atm is just temporary.
	Add keywords/language employers would want to see.
	Add actual photo of myself.
	Find a way to make about section more interesting, black text on the dark blue doesn't really work.

Card Improvements:
	Better styles - not sure what to do really.
	Carousel for more cards
		1 card shown for mobile swipe left or right to view more
		4 shown for medium left or right arrows to view more (or swipe)
		6 shown for large left or right arrows to view more (or swipe)

Own backend for contact form; currently using formspree
	include email on side of contact me (example: https://codepen.io/daniloaquino/full/bqqKPZ/)

Smooth scroll for Nav links.
	Full-vh home with down-arrow nav at bottom of page anchor with smooth scroll to about me

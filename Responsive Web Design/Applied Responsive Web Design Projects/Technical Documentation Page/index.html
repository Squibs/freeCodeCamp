			<article>
				<p>AMD AM4-based Ryzen processors are unlocked when paired with the enabling AMD chipsets
					and necessary BIOS software and therefore allow the user to adjust the CPU clock above or below
					the stock value. When run on boards enabled for overclocking, AMD Ryzen Master will
					automatically enable the Overclocking Mode at the user’s initiation of a change to a stock
					parameter. The CPU will be returned to stock operation through a system power cycle.</p>
				<p>The process for finding a stable overclocking configuration with the AMD Ryzen processor is not
					fundamentally different from the previous generation AMD processors (such as the AMD FX
					processors). The final operating voltages and frequencies will depend highly on the specific
					system’s processor, motherboard, cooling solution, operating environment, and the user’s
					decisions on what elements to overclock and to what degree. </p>

			<section id="4.1_AMD_Ryzen_Processor_Normal_Operation" class="sub-section">
				<header><span class="subChapter">4.1</span> AMD Ryzen Processor Normal Operation</header>
				<article>
					<p>To describe how the AMD processor operates in Overclocking Mode it is best to understand how
						the AMD Ryzen processor operates normally. When operating normally, the AMD Ryzen
						processor has the following characteristics:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The frequency of processor core clock is determined by a combination of the softwarerequested
							p-state and then adjusted by a combination of numerous power and performance
							optimizing features to attain any of number of fine grain p-states around that softwarerequested
							p-state.</li>
						<li>Internal control mechanisms measure internal temperatures, power and current consumption,
							and manage the operating voltage and frequency of various internal cores to maintain specified
							levels. For example, when the number of active cores is below a pre-determined threshold, the
							active core temperatures are below maximum, and the consumed total current is below
							infrastructure limits, then those active cores will be boosted in voltage and frequency to the cstate
							“boost” frequency until any of those conditions are no longer true.</li>
						<li>The voltages for some of the various cores are internally generated from external supplies. For
							example, each of the processor cores uses a supply independently generated from the external
							supply. As the operating frequency for each processor core is adjusted to attain various fine
							grain p-states, the operating voltage of the core is adjusted to support that new frequency at
							optimal power consumption. The voltage adjustments are done using the internal voltage
							regulator and the SVI2 controlled external supply voltage, if needed.</li>
						<li>Software requested p-state or halt states adjust the level of power to which those internal
							control mechanisms manage. For example, when software executes a HALT instruction on a
							processor core, that core will enter the C1 reduced-power state. If that core does not receive 
							an interrupt to resume execution, it will progress to increasingly-lower power states until
							finally saving the state of the core and being powered off.</li>
						<li>The internal memory controller and various other data paths will be initialized to the highest
							common operating frequency of any of the memory DIMMS present in the system and with
							memory timing parameters obtained from the DIMM resident SPD ROMs.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A fundamental assumption of the normal operation of the AMD Ryzen processor is that the
						surrounding system current delivery and cooling capabilities are designed to the specified levels.
						The complicated operation described above manages the overall AMD Ryzen processor operation
						to maintain those specified capabilities. But what can be done if the system provides more current
						and cooling than those required for normal operation?</p>

			<section id="4.2_AMD_Ryzen_Processor_Overclocking_Mode" class="sub-section">
				<header><span class="subChapter">4.2</span> AMD Ryzen Processor Overclocking Mode</header>
				<article>
					<p>The AMD Ryzen processor supports an operating mode allowing enthusiast users to directly
						control the operating condition of the processor to precisely tune the performance and power
						consumption to the extent of their specific and unique system capabilities (current and cooling)
						and environmental conditions (ambient temperature). This is done by allowing the user to
						program or run utilities to directly set the precise voltage and frequency at which the CPU operates
						so that the maximum performance can be achieved. This is called the Overclocking Mode. This
						mode still uses the processor’s control methods for the external power supplies (SVI2) and
						internal clock generators and divisors thereby simplifying the implementation and eliminating any
						needs for voltage regulator overrides or external clock generators. This mode allows
						overclocking-capable motherboards to use the same voltage regulator controllers and the same
						BIOS to support normal operation and overclocking.</p>

			<section id="4.3_CPU_Overclocking_Enablement" class="sub-section">
				<header><span class="subChapter">4.3</span> CPU Overclocking Enablement</header>
				<article>
					<p>When used on an overclocking-enabled motherboard, an AMD Ryzen processor is ready for
						Overclocking Mode. The processor will run normally with all internal power, voltage, and
						thermal management features enabled until a point in time when user-directed system software reprograms
						the specific voltage and frequency values to levels other than stock operating values.
						The following changes take effect when the values are re-programmed and the processor enters
						Overclocking Mode:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>All enabled CPU cores operate at the newly user-programmed voltage and P0 frequency value.
							Adjustment of the CPU clock is in 25MHz steps.</li>
						<li>Internal features of the processor which control the CPU operating voltage and frequency to
							manage the CPU temperature, current consumption, and power consumption to specified
							maximums are disabled so that no additional stress to system voltage regulators and thermals
							are induced. This includes c-state boost.</li>
						<li>CPU low power c-states (CC1, CC6, and PC6) and software visible p-states (P1 and P2)
							remain operational and may be requested by software so that power savings can be achieved.</li>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>The P1 and P2 p-state tables may also be modified to adjust the voltage and frequency of
								the CPU when running in software-requested, reduced-performance states. These may also
								be left at stock values.</li>
							<li>If the OS-level software power policy is also changed so that the CPU’s power-saving pstates
								are not used, then these power-saving states will never be requested.</li>
							<li>If AMD Cool’N’Quiet is disabled, then low power c-states will also be disabled.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<li>Various internal voltage regulators supplying CPU core power are placed into bypass mode,
							allowing the external VDDCR_CPU to directly supply the CPU cores.</li>

				<p>The new AMD Ryzen Master application supports AMD’s new generation of Socket AM4
					processors. This new application no longer includes GPU overclocking as was provided in the
					former AMD OverDrive™ utility. For overclocking AMD’s discrete graphics cards, see the
					Radeon WattMan GPU Overclocking utility within the Radeon Software provided with AMD
					discrete graphics cards. AMD Ryzen Master is compatible with GPU overclocking tools provided
					by other discrete graphics card manufacturers.</p>
				<p>AMD Ryzen Master allows the user to control various clock and voltage settings in real time
					directly from supported Windows Operating System. In addition to real-time control there are
					certain adjustable parameters – normally found only inside the BIOS menu – that require a system
					restart for applying the new values. </p>
				<p>The use of the AMD Ryzen Master application requires that the user accepts the End User License
					Agreement and inherent risks of configuring the AMD processor to performance levels that
					exceed specifications and stock settings</p>

			<section id="5.2_CPU_Overclocking_Example" class="sub-section">
				<header><span class="subChapter">5.2</span> CPU Overclocking Example</header>
				<article>
					<p><i>Examples of CPU configurations, cores and frequencies described herein are examples only and
							do not necessarily reflect commercially available products or overclocking range.</i></p>
					<p>The CPU core clock is by far the most important performance tuning knob available on the AMD
						Ryzen processor. The following example shows the necessary steps for CPU overclocking using
						AMD Ryzen Master.</p>
					<p>In the below example AMD Ryzen Master has been launched while the CPU is running at the
						given core clock speed and CPU voltage. AMD Ryzen Master opens the Current profile (“C”
						profile tab in the lower left corner of the UI). The Current profile reflects the current CPU settings
						from boot or as applied from an AMD Ryzen Master profile; it is read-only and does not directly
						allow user adjustments.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img3.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 3. Current settings for AMD Ryzen Master application</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The values can be adjusted by selecting one of the four user editable profiles (1 to 4). In the below
						example Profile 1 has been selected.</p>
					<p>To Overclock the CPU the user needs to adjust the CPU clock. There are five ways to do this with
						AMD Ryzen Master:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>dragging the yellow dot in the clock slider</li>
						<li>by typing in the desired CPU clock in the text box.</li>
						<li>by clicking the up and down buttons with mouse</li>
						<li>by clicking the Speed text box (left mouse button) and then dialing in the desired value using
							keyboard up/down button</li>
						<li>by activating the text box and adjusting the value with mouse scroll wheel</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The CPU clock can be adjusted in 25 MHz steps.</p>
					<p>CPU Voltage can be adjusted by typing in a new value in the CPU VID text box. The example
						below uses a value of 1.40V. The CPU voltage can be adjusted in 0.00625V steps.</p>
					<p><i><b>Note:</b> Some motherboards may apply a voltage offset from the BIOS. In this case the actual CPU
						voltage may be higher (or lower) than what the CPU VID value suggests. It’s always a
						good idea to monitor the actual voltage level (from the BIOS or with the motherboard
						vendors monitoring application).</i></p>
					<p><i><b>Caution:</b> Raising the CPU Voltage above the stock setting is the single-most contributing factor
						to reduced life of the processor and/or damage due to transistor over-stress and
						temperature. Each individual CPU unit may respond to changes in CPU Voltage
						differently.</i></p>
					<p>The settings are not applied until the user clicks the “Apply” button in the upper right corner of the
						UI. Clicking “Apply” will also automatically save the settings to the active profile.</p>
					<p><i><b>Note:</b> Under overclocking mode all CPU Cores will operate at the same frequency and voltage.</i></p>
					<p>It’s a good idea to verify the performance increase and stability by running CPU performance
						benchmark(s) and stability tests (example: Maxon’s CINEBENCH R15). Please close all
						background apps to ensure stable and consistent performance results run-to-run, but expect some
						variation.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img4.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 4. AMD Ryzen Master example</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The recommendation is to increase the CPU clock in small steps while monitoring CPU
						performance, stability and CPU, motherboard, system and GPU temperatures.</p>
					<p>Once an unstable CPU clock has been reached and the CPU temperature is not too high it’s
						possible to increase the CPU voltage in small steps to see if the increased CPU voltage allows
						stable operation at higher frequencies.</p>
					<p>The optimal settings for this profile can be saved by clicking the “Save Profile” button. To apply
						a saved profile, launch AMD Ryzen Master, browse to the desired profile and click “Apply”.</p>

					<p>AMD Ryzen Master features a Histogram for monitoring the CPU core clock speeds and the CPU
						temperature. The Histogram can be expanded and minimized by clicking the ˅ and ˃ buttons. The
						Speed and Temperature histograms may be individually displayed via their respective check
						boxes.</p>
					<p>The Speed Histogram graph displays the sampled current (instantaneous) clock speeds of enabled
						cores. The Current, Peak or Avg core clock speeds are available per core left of the Histogram.
						The User may select which parameter is displayed. Each Core can be individually displayed

						displays the Current core clock speed. A core’s check box color corresponds to that core’s line
						color in the histogram.</p>
					<p>The Temperature Histogram displays approximate CPU die temperature averaged across a range
						of sensors across the die, down to 0C.</p>
					<p>To the left of the core speed sliders is displayed the instantaneous peak speed of the fasted core

						This may improve overclocking headroom for the remaining CPU cores or can be used to reduce
						the overall CPU power consumption. Please refer to Chapter 7 for further information on AMD
						Ryzen processor core configuration.</p>
					<p>By default, the CPU runs with all cores enabled. AMD Ryzen Master supports disabling cores in
						pairs. For example, an 8-core AMD Ryzen processor model can be configured to disable two,
						four or six cores. Disabling all cores is not supported since the product would cease to function
						with no enabled cores. Note that disabling cores will disable the Windows Sleep option. When you
						want to restore all cores and the Windows Sleep option, use Windows Shut down, then restart.</p>
					<p>The below example outlines the necessary steps for disabling two CPU cores which results in six
						enabled cores.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img6.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 6: CPU Core Configuration - Disabling Two Cores</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The first step includes activating the user-editable Profile 1 by clicking “1” from the lower left
						corner. In this example two cores are disabled and the settings are applied by hitting “Apply”
						from the upper right corner.</p>
					<p>Since Core Disable requires a system reboot the following pop up message will appear. Click
						“OK” to reboot the system or “Cancel” if you do not wish to disable the cores now.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img7.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 7. CPU Core Configuration - System Restart Pop-Up</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Once the system has rebooted back to the Operating System, AMD Ryzen Master is <u>automatically</u>
						launched. <u>It is important to give the OS and AMD Ryzen Master a few moments to initialize after
						this step.</u> Do not re-start AMD Ryzen Master manually or you will get the message that another
						instance of AMD Ryzen Master is already running, either the automatic one or the one you
						opened, and the second instance cannot start.</p>
					<p>The following screenshot shows the new default profile with six enabled cores and two disabled
						cores.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img8.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 8. CPU Core Configuration - Two Cores Disabled</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The number of enabled cores can be verified by opening the Windows 10 Task Manager and the
						Performance tab (change the CPU graph to display Logical processors:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img9.jpg"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 9. Windows® 10 Task Manager with six enabled CPU cores</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Note that since the disabled cores have been hidden from the OS, they will not appear as idle or
						parked in any Windows resource-monitoring application until enabled.</p>
					<p>Note also that most applications that report the number of cores or threads, such as benchmarks,
						sample the CPU resources only when first started and will not register changes to CPU core count
						or frequency that you change via AMD Ryzen Master. Always re-open such monitoring
						applications after AMD Ryzen Master changes are applied.</p>
					<p>Certain CPU monitoring tools are able to track dynamic changes initiated by AMD Ryzen Master.</p>
					<p>In order to re-enable the disabled cores, the system must be powered off completely (alternatively
						the motherboard may initiate a cold reset) and restarted.</p>
					<p>Note that Windows® 10 must be configured in the Power Options to disable fast startup when the
						chassis power button is pressed to turn the system on. Make sure the box is <u>unchecked</u> for “Turn
						on fast startup”</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img10.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 10. Windows® Power Options configuration</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>It is possible to disable additional cores without cold resetting the system (i.e. a normal OS
						system restart will work here). Therefore the user can switch within a profile or across profiles
						from 8 to 6 to 4 to 2 cores without shutting down the system.</p>

				<header><span class="subChapter">5.5</span> Memory Overclocking</header>
				<article>
					<p>AMD Ryzen Master offers an easy-to-use graphical user interface for adjusting the most important
						memory parameters.</p>
					<p>Memory performance can be tuned by increasing the memory clock or by reducing the memory
						timings and latency. Typically, the higher memory clocks require higher memory timing values
						but in some cases, it may be possible to maintain the timings or even lower them. Results will
						vary depending on the exact configuration.</p>
					<p>If the memory modules support a higher memory clock it’s recommended to apply the timings as
						per the memory specification (SPD settings).</p>
					<p>The following example uses a dual channel DDR4-2400 memory kit (CL17-17-17-17-39 timings,
						1.2 V voltage, 2x8 GB).</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img11.jpg"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 11. AMD Ryzen Master Application - Memory Overclocking Example</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>In the above example the memory clock is adjusted from default 1200MHz (DDR4-2400) to
						1333 MHz (DDR4-2666) while timings have been increased from 17-17-17-17-39 to 18-18-18-18-
						40. Memory voltage was also adjusted from default 1.20V up to 1.296V and SOC Voltage was set
						to 1.20 V. Note that Memory VTT voltage will automatically be set to half of Memory voltage
						(MEM VDDIO).</p>
					<p>System restart is required for applying the settings as memory needs to be retrained for the new
						values.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/img12.png"/>
						<figcaption><b>Figure 12. System Reboot Pop-Up Message Following Memory Adjustments</b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Click “OK” to reboot the system and apply the new memory settings.</p>
					<p><i><b>Note:</b> Memory settings should be adjusted with great care as incorrect or unstable settings may
						prevent the system from booting up or may fail to load the OS (including corrupting the OS
						installation). Running a stand-alone memory stability test (such as MemTest86™) is
						recommended for checking the memory stability in advance of loading the OS.</i></p>

				<p>As core counts increase for enthusiast processors, it becomes valuable for the user to have control
					over how many cores are accessible to software. A performance-tuned system running low
					thread-count software and four enabled cores might be optimal for one user. Alternatively, a
					performance-tuned system with all cores enabled might be better for another user.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The number of enabled CPU cores may be reduced from the maximum to tune the available
						number of threads of execution and the associated CPU power requirements and related
						cooling requirements to achieve maximum performance for given applications.</li>
					<li>Reduction of the number of enabled CPU cores from the maximum will reduce the current and
						power consumed by the processor. This power consumption reduction can allow the user to
						avoid current delivery limitations of the system, avoid processor cooling limitations of the
						system, and/or allow the enabled CPU cores to operate at lower temperatures and therefore
						potentially higher frequencies.</li>
					<li>Through core configuration the number of cores to be enabled is selected by the user and after
						a system restart, only that number of cores is initialized and reported to the operating system
						for task scheduling. This is a static assignment of enabled cores per system boot. Note that
						disabling cores will disable the Windows Sleep option. When you want to restore all cores and
						the Windows Sleep option, use Windows Shut down, then restart.</li>
					<li>The AMD Ryzen processor operates all cores at the same operating frequency. This provides
						uniform performance for each enabled core to the operating system task scheduler. In
						overclocking mode, each core is supplied power directly from the external VDDCR_CPU
						supply and therefore at the same voltage.</li>
					<li>Core configuration allows for cores to be disabled in logical pairs. Cores may be disabled in
						increments of two up to two less than the total cores provided by the given processor model.
						For example, a four-core model will allow only two cores to be disabled, leaving two cores
						active. An eight-core model will allow two, four or six cores to be disabled, leaving no less
						than two cores active.</li>
					<li>To re-activate disabled cores, the system must be cold reset and restarted. Upon restart, the
						processor will be returned to stock configuration and all originally available cores will be
						enabled</li>

				<header><span class="subChapter">7.1</span> Enabling HPET</header>
				<article>
					<p>At launch, March 2, 2017, the AMD Ryzen processor required the High Precision Event Timer
						service (HPET) for overclocking. Later system BIOS improvements have eliminated the need for
						HPET for overclocking. AMD Ryzen Master automatically determines which mode to function
						in. If your system BIOS requires HPET for AMD Ryzen processor overclocking, AMD Ryzen
						Master will request that you enable the HPET service.</p>
					<p><b>Option 1 - to enable HPET:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>To start a command prompt <u>as an administrator,</u> in the Windows Start field, type "cmd" then
							hold down <b>Ctrl-Shift</b> buttons and press <b>Enter</b>.</li>
						<li>Execute the "HPET.bat" available from the installation path of the AMD Ryzen Master
							application</li>
						<li>If HPET is already enabled, then no action is performed else the HPET.bat file will enable
							HPET</li>
						<li>Restart the system</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Option 2 - to enable HPET:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>To start a command prompt as an administrator, in the Windows Start field, type "cmd" then
							hold down Ctrl-Shift with Enter.</li>
						<li>In the command window, enter "bcdedit /set useplatformclock true"</li>
						<li>Exit command window</li>
						<li>Restart the system</li>
					</ul>
					<p><i><b>Note:</b> If system is not restarted after HPET is enabled, the Application will not behave as expected</i></p>
					<p>Please also note that updates of Windows may reset and disable HPET. If you find that AMD
						Ryzen Master has been running fine but unexpectedly begins warning you that HPET is not
						enabled, your OS has probably been updated. In that case, please run the above instructions for
						enabling HPET; it is not necessary to re-install AMD Ryzen Master.</p>

					<p>If you are upgrading your system to the new AMD Ryzen Master 1.0.1 and have upgraded your
						system BIOS eliminating the need for HPET, you may want to disable HPET present from prior
						installation of AMD Ryzen Master 1.0 and HPET enablement, or perhaps HPET was enabled by
						default independent of AMD Ryzen Master. Disabling HPET may improve the performance of
						some applications by eliminating the HPET service's consumption of CPU resources. Beware that
						other applications you use may depend on the HPET service.</p>
					<p><b>To disable HPET:</b></p>

					<p>For workloads that can use the full thread capacity of the CPU, the OS power policy should be set

			<section id="7.5_AMD_Ryzen_Master_Processor_Resource_Consumption" class="sub-section">
				<header><span class="subChapter">7.5</span> AMD Ryzen Master Processor Resource Consumption</header>
				<article>
					<p>Since AMD Ryzen Master is an application and samples many processor parameters to display
						real-time performance information, it consumes processor resources but presents a light load at
						idle. You may notice AMD Ryzen Master taking slightly more resources as a percentage when a
						heavy workload is running, such as a highly-threaded benchmark. The multi-thread workload of
						Maxon’s CINEBENCH benchmark is a good example of this behavior. This is due to the
						operating system’s higher overhead of thread-context switching between AMD Ryzen Master and
						the other workload.</p>
					<p>If a highly-threaded application can consume all available thread capacity and maximum
						performance is important, you have several options:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If you are using an application to test stability and need AMD Ryzen Master open to continue
							optimizing the overclocking configuration, you can lower the AMD Ryzen Master process
							priority as follows:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Open Windows 10 Task Manager</li>
							<li>In the Applications tab, locate and right-click on the Ryzen Master Application icon and
								select 'Go To details' from the menu. You will be taken to the Details tab and the Ryzen
								Master process will be highlighted. To stabilize the process list, left-click on the column
								Name heading to sort alphabetically, then scroll down to the AMD Ryzen Master process.</li>
							<li>Right-click on the AMD Ryzen Master process, hover over the Set Priority option and set to
								'Below Normal' or 'Low'</li>
							<li>Run your stability test applications. If your application can consume 90% or more of the
								processing resource, you may notice that AMD Ryzen Master becomes unresponsive as the
								application is using all the CPU resource it can consume. Under that extreme condition,
								once the application finishes, or your pause it, AMD Ryzen Master will resume monitoring
								where it left off when you started the application.</li>
						</ul>

						<li>If you don't need AMD Ryzen Master open, then simply close it and proceed with your
							benchmarking and normal operations. The overclocked settings you configured with AMD
							Ryzen Master will persist after closing AMD Ryzen Master.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Example: When running CINEBENCH for maximum score while over-clocked</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Set the Windows power policy to “High Performance”</li>
						<li>Lower the AMD Ryzen Master priority as described above</li>

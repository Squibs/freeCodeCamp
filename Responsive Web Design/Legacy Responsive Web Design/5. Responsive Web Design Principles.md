## Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Challenges

Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. The page structure ad CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences.

Knowing your target audience helps out in Responsive Web Design. If your target audience is mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach by designing based on mobile devices and adding conditional rules for larger screen sizes. The opposite if your audience is on larger screens.

This section will cover basic ways to use CSS for Responsive Web Design.

## Create a Media Query

```HTML
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  
  /* Add media query below */
  @media (max-height: 800px) {
    p{
      font-size: 10px;
    }
  }
</style>
  
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus quis tempus massa. Aenean erat nisl, gravida vel vestibulum cursus, interdum sit amet lectus. Sed sit amet quam nibh. Suspendisse quis tincidunt nulla. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Ut sit amet pretium nisl. Vivamus vel mi sem. Aenean sit amet consectetur sem. Suspendisse pretium, purus et gravida consequat, nunc ligula ultricies diam, at aliquet velit libero a dui.</p>
```

Media Queries are a way to change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. A media query is only applied if the media type matches that of the device being used. A frequent type to match is screen width or height.

## Make an Image Responsive

```HTML
<style>
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
    height: auto;
  }
</style>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/FCCStickerPack.jpg" alt="freeCodeCamp stickers set">
```

The `max-width` property of 100% scales an image to fit the width of its container, but the image will not stretch to be wider than its original width. Setting the `display` property to block, changes the image from an inline element, to a block element on its own line. The `height` property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.

## Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays

```HTML
<style>
  img { width: 100px; height: 100px;}
</style>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/FCCStickers-CamperBot200x200.jpg" alt="freeCodeCamp sticker that says 'Because CamperBot Cares'">
```

Setting the `width` and `height` of an image to half of what their original size is will optimize an image for retina displays.

## Make Typography Responsive

```HTML
<style>
  h2 {
    width: 80vw;
  }
  p {
    width: 75vmin;
  }
</style>

<h2>Importantus Ipsum</h2>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus quis tempus massa. Aenean erat nisl, gravida vel vestibulum cursus, interdum sit amet lectus. Sed sit amet quam nibh. Suspendisse quis tincidunt nulla. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Ut sit amet pretium nisl. Vivamus vel mi sem. Aenean sit amet consectetur sem. Suspendisse pretium, purus et gravida consequat, nunc ligula ultricies diam, at aliquet velit libero a dui.</p>
```

Viewport units are another type of relative units that are based off of viewport size.

`vw: 10vw` would be 10% of the viewport's width.

`vh: 3vh` would be 3% of the viewport's height.

`vmin: 70vmin` would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).

`vmax: 100vmax` would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs width).

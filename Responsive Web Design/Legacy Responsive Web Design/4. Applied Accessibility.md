## Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges

"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:

1. Have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup.
2. Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content.
3. Create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly.

A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

---

## Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility

```HTML
<img src="doingKarateWow.jpeg" alt="Camper Cat is doing karate."/>
```

`alt` Text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative. This is also used in search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results.

Having an `alt` attribute is mandatory by HTML5 standards.

---

## Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank

```HTML
<h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>

<img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">

<article>
  <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>
```

It is sometimes okay to not have a descriptive `alt` attribute for an image. In cases where there is a displayed caption already describing the image or if the image is purely for decoration, it is not completely necessary to include a descriptive text in the `alt` attribute.

Putting one in can still help for search engines however.

---

## Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content

```HTML
<h1>How to Become a Ninja</h1>
<main>
  <h2>Learn the Art of Moving Stealthily</h2>
  <h3>How to Hide in Plain Sight</h3>
  <h3>How to Climb a Wall</h3>

  <h2>Learn the Art of Battle</h2>
  <h3>How to Strengthen your Body</h3>
  <h3>How to Fight like a Ninja</h3>

  <h2>Learn the Art of Living with Honor</h2>
  <h3>How to Breathe Properly</h3>
  <h3>How to Simplify your Life</h3>
</main>
```

Headings (`h1` through `h6` elements) are tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers have the ability to be set to only read the headings on a page so that the user can get a quick summary or skim around the content. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, and not picked merely for their size values.

---

## Jump Straight to the Content Using the main Element

```HTML
<header>
  <h1>Weapons of the Ninja</h1>
</header>
<main>
  
</main>
<footer></footer>
```

HTML5 introduced several new elements that give developers more options to incorporate accessibility features. These tags include `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, and `section`, among others.

All these tags are rendered similarly to the `div` tag, but using these tags where appropriate can give a lot of additional meaning.

---

## Wrap Content in the article Element

```HTML
<h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
<main>
  <article>
    <h2>The Garfield Files: Lasagna as Training Fuel?</h2>
    <p>The internet is littered with varying opinions on nutritional paradigms, from catnip paleo to hairball cleanses. But let's turn our attention to an often overlooked fitness fuel, and examine the protein-carb-NOM trifecta that is lasagna...</p>
  </article>

  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">

  <article>
    <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
    <p>Felines the world over have been waging war on the most persistent of foes. This red nemesis combines both cunning stealth and lightening speed. But chin up, fellow fighters, our time for victory may soon be near...</p>
  </article>

  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">

  <article>
    <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
    <p>Chuck Norris is widely regarded as the premier martial artist on the planet, and it's a complete coincidence anyone who disagrees with this fact mysteriously disappears soon after. But the real question is, is he a cat person?...</p>
  </article>
</main>
```

The `<article>` tag is used to indicate independent, self-contained content. This tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

The `<section>` tag is similar to the article tag; however, it wraps thematically related content together.

Both of these tags can be used within each other. For example, if a book is the `article` then each chapter is a `section`. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a `<div>` (division).

## Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header Landmark

```HTML
<body>

  <header>
    <h1>Training with Camper Cat</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="stealth">
      <h2>Stealth &amp; Agility Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Climb foliage quickly using a minimum spanning tree approach</h3></article>
      <article><h3>No training is NP-complete without parkour</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="combat">
      <h2>Combat Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Dispatch multiple enemies with multithreaded tactics</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Goodbye world: 5 proven ways to knock out an opponent</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="weapons">
      <h2>Weapons Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Swords: the best tool to literally divide and conquer</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Breadth-first or depth-first in multi-weapon training?</h3></article>
    </section>
  </main>
</body>
```

The `<header>` tag is used for introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

---

## Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the nav Landmark

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Training with Camper Cat</h1>

    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#stealth">Stealth &amp; Agility</a></li>
        <li><a href="#combat">Combat</a></li>
        <li><a href="#weapons">Weapons</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="stealth">
      <h2>Stealth &amp; Agility Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Climb foliage quickly using a minimum spanning tree approach</h3></article>
      <article><h3>No training is NP-complete without parkour</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="combat">
      <h2>Combat Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Dispatch multiple enemies with multithreaded tactics</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Goodbye world: 5 proven ways to knock out an opponent</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="weapons">
      <h2>Weapons Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Swords: the best tool to literally divide and conquer</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Breadth-first or depth-first in multi-weapon training?</h3></article>
    </section>
  </main>
</body>
```

The `<nav>` tag is used to mark what is considered navigation links for your page.

---

## Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the footer Landmark

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Training</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#stealth">Stealth &amp; Agility</a></li>
        <li><a href="#combat">Combat</a></li>
        <li><a href="#weapons">Weapons</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="stealth">
      <h2>Stealth &amp; Agility Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Climb foliage quickly using a minimum spanning tree approach</h3></article>
      <article><h3>No training is NP-complete without parkour</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="combat">
      <h2>Combat Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Dispatch multiple enemies with multithreaded tactics</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Goodbye world: 5 proven ways to knock out an opponent</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="weapons">
      <h2>Weapons Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Swords: the best tool to literally divide and conquer</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Breadth-first or depth-first in multi-weapon training?</h3></article>
    </section>
  </main>

  <footer>&copy; 2018 Camper Cat</footer>

</body>
```

The `<footer>` tag is primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

---

## Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Real Coding Ninjas</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>A sound clip of Zersiax's screen reader in action.</p>
    
    <audio controls>
      <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
    </audio>
    
  </main>
</body>
```

The `<audio>` element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. 

Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to the deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

---

## Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Training</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#stealth">Stealth &amp; Agility</a></li>
        <li><a href="#combat">Combat</a></li>
        <li><a href="#weapons">Weapons</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      
      <!-- Add your code below this line -->
      <figure>
        <!-- Stacked bar chart will go here -->
        <br>
        <figcaption>Breakdown per week of time to spend training in stealth, combat, and weapons.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <!-- Add your code above this line -->
      
    </section>
    <section id="stealth">
      <h2>Stealth &amp; Agility Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Climb foliage quickly using a minimum spanning tree approach</h3></article>
      <article><h3>No training is NP-complete without parkour</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="combat">
      <h2>Combat Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Dispatch multiple enemies with multithreaded tactics</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Goodbye world: 5 proven ways to knock out an opponent</h3></article>
    </section>
    <section id="weapons">
      <h2>Weapons Training</h2>
      <article><h3>Swords: the best tool to literally divide and conquer</h3></article>
      <article><h3>Breadth-first or depth-first in multi-weapon training?</h3></article>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>&copy; 2016 Camper Cat</footer>
</body>
```

The `<figure>` element, along with the related `figcaption`, wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the `figure`.

## Improve Form Field Accessibility with the label Element

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <form>
      <p>Sign up to receive Camper Cat's blog posts by email here!</p>
      
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" name="email">
      
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </section>
  <article>
    <h2>The Garfield Files: Lasagna as Training Fuel?</h2>
    <p>The internet is littered with varying opinions on nutritional paradigms, from catnip paleo to hairball cleanses. But let's turn our attention to an often overlooked fitness fuel, and examine the protein-carb-NOM trifecta that is lasagna...</p>
  </article>
  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">
  <article>
    <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
    <p>Felines the world over have been waging war on the most persistent of foes. This red nemesis combines both cunning stealth and lightening speed. But chin up, fellow fighters, our time for victory may soon be near...</p>
  </article>
  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">
  <article>
    <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
    <p>Chuck Norris is widely regarded as the premier martial artist on the planet, and it's a complete coincidence anyone who disagrees with this fact mysteriously disappears soon after. But the real question is, is he a cat person?...</p>
  </article>
  <footer>&copy; 2016 Camper Cat</footer>
</body>
```

The `<label>` tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable.

The `for` attribute on a `label` tag associates that `label` with the form control and is used by screen readers.

## Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <form>
      <p>Sign up to receive Camper Cat's blog posts by email here!</p>
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" name="email">
      
      <!-- Add your code below this line -->
      <fieldset>
        <legend>What level ninja are you?</legend>
        <input id="newbie" type="radio" name="levels" value="newbie">
        <label for="newbie">Newbie Kitten</label><br>
        <input id="intermediate" type="radio" name="levels" value="intermediate">
        <label for="intermediate">Developing Student</label><br>
        <input id="master" type="radio" name="levels" value="master">
        <label for="master">Master</label>
      </fieldset>
      <!-- Add your code above this line -->
      
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </section>
  <article>
    <h2>The Garfield Files: Lasagna as Training Fuel?</h2>
    <p>The internet is littered with varying opinions on nutritional paradigms, from catnip paleo to hairball cleanses. But let's turn our attention to an often overlooked fitness fuel, and examine the protein-carb-NOM trifecta that is lasagna...</p>
  </article>
  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">
  <article>
    <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
    <p>Felines the world over have been waging war on the most persistent of foes. This red nemesis combines both cunning stealth and lightening speed. But chin up, fellow fighters, our time for victory may soon be near...</p>
  </article>
  <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">
  <article>
    <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
    <p>Chuck Norris is widely regarded as the premier martial artist on the planet, and it's a complete coincidence anyone who disagrees with this fact mysteriously disappears soon after. But the real question is, is he a cat person?...</p>
  </article>
  <footer>&copy; 2016 Camper Cat</footer>
</body>
```

Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set. The `<fieldset>` tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons and their respective `label`(s) with `for` attributes, to achieve this.

The `<legend>` tag is used within the `fieldset` to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the `fieldset` element.

---

## Add an Accessible Date Picker

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Tournaments</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Mortal Combat Tournament Survey</h2>
      <form>
        <p>Tell us the best date for the competition</p>
        <label for="pickdate">Preferred Date:</label>
        
        <!-- Add your code below this line -->
        
        <label for="date">Enter a date:</label>
        <input type="date" id="pickdate" name="date"/>
        
        <!-- Add your code above this line -->
        
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
      </form>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>&copy; 2016 Camper Cat</footer>
</body>
```

HTML5 introduced the ability to set the `type` attribute to `date` in an `input` element. This can help screen readers know what type of input they are currently at.

Older browsers, will set the type to a default of `text`. It helps to show users the expected date format in the label or as placeholder text just in case because of this.

---

## Standardize Times with the HTML5 datetime Attribute

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Tournaments</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h2>Mortal Combat Tournament Survey Results</h2>
    
    <!-- Add your code below this line -->
    
    <p>Thank you to everyone for responding to Master Camper Cat's survey. The best day to host the vaunted Mortal Combat tournament is <time datetime="2016-09-15">Thursday, September 15<sup>th</sup></time>. May the best ninja win!</p>
    
    <!-- Add your code above this line -->
    
    <section>

      </article>
    </section>
  </article>
  <footer>&copy; 2016 Camper Cat</footer>
</body>
```

The `<time>` tag is used wrap around a specific date or time.

The `datetime` attribute is used in this tag to standardize times in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

You can use CSS to hide content meant only for screen readers by pushing the content completely off the screen and making it a size that does not matter.

`display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` hides content for everyone, including screen readers.

Setting zero values for pixel sizes, such as `width: 0px; height: 0px;` will also be ignored by screen readers.

    background-color: #FFF;
  }

    <p>The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury tournament.</p>
    <p>As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall continue as purely recreational.</p>

## Avoid Colorblindness Issues by Using Sufficient Contrast

```HTML
<head>
  <style>
  body {
    color: hsl(0, 55%, 15%);
    background-color: hsl(120, 25%, 55%);
  }

The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.

## Avoid Colorblindness Issues by Carefully Choosing Colors that Convey 
```HTML
<head>
  <style>
  button {
    color: #003366;
    background-color: #FFFF33;
    font-size: 14px;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Danger!</h1>
  </header>
  <button>Delete Internet</button>
</body>
```

Colorblindness is another accessibility factor to consider when choosing colors. While some color combinations might look completely fine for regular users, it can be hard for some colorblind types to be able to read some fonts depending on the color combinations.

## Give Links Meaning by Using Descriptive Link Text

```HTML
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
    <p>Felines the world over have been waging war on the most persistent of foes. This red nemesis combines both cunning stealth and lightening speed. But chin up, fellow fighters, our time for victory may soon be near. Click here for <a href="">information about batteries</a></p>
  </article>
</body>
```

Rather than just saying "click here" and having that only be the link. Consider making the whole statement the link instead, "click here for information about batteries."

## Use tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element

```HTML
<head>
  <style>
  p:focus {

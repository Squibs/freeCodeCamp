# Coding Interview Prep and freeCodeCamp Legacy Projects

This section acts as just bonus lessons and projects in which can be done for extra practice. Several of the projects in the *Take Home Projects* section are legacy projects, which were in the freeCodeCamp curriculum before they updated the site with their updated lessons and projects from their beta website.

Click the links below to navigate through each section and view the solutions I came up with for challenges and my completed projects. If a section is ~~crossed out~~, I have not yet finished the section and will update this list when I complete it in the future.

# Take Home Projects

Some of these projects were in the original curriculum for freeCodeCamp before the freeCodeCamp *beta* curriculum was officially released. Many, if not most of these projects, will have their own repository outside of this one. Click any of the links below to view my notes and thoughts I came up with while going through these *Take Home Projects* on freeCodeCamp.

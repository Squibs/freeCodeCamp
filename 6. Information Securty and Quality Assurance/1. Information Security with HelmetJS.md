## Introduction to Information Security with HelmetJS Challenges

This section has all of the lesson notes inside the code, which I'll be linking as part of the solution, so my notes may seem pretty redundant throughout (for the most part I just tried to pull out the most important information).

HelmetJS is a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers to prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client. HelmetJS does not account for all situations, but does include support for common ones like Content Security Policy, XSS Filtering, and HTTP Strict Transport Security.

The [HelmetJS Documents](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/) has more information about what each of these middlewares/modules do.

**You can view this project and project files: [On Glitch!](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-squibs-helmetjs?path=myApp.js)**

**I have created a backup of the project files: [Here](./fcc-squibs-helmetjs/)**

## Install and Require Helmet

```JavaScript
/**********************************************
* 4. Applied InfoSec Challenges
* =============================
***********************************************/

var express = require('express'); // Do Not Edit
var app = express();              // Do Not Edit

// ----

/** - Challenges - *
********************/ 

/** 1) Install and require `helmet` */

// [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) helps you secure your
// Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
// Install the package, then require it.

const helmet = require('helmet');
```

```JSON
{
  "name": "fcc-infosec-challenges",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "fcc backend boilerplate",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node myApp.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.14.0",
    "helmet": "^3.13.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "4.4.5"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "hyperdev",
    "express",
    "freecodecamp"
  ],
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

This is just an initial challenge to install HelmetJS via npm, and have it listed as a dependency.

---

## Hide Potentially Dangerous Information Using helmet.hidePoweredBy()

```JavaScript
/** 2) Hide potentially dangerous information - `helmet.hidePoweredBy()` */

// Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node
// if they see that your site is powered by Express. `X-Powered-By: Express`
// is sent in every request coming from Express by default.

// The `hidePoweredBy` middleware will remove the `X-Powered-By` header.
// You can also explicitly set the header to something else, to throw
// people off. e.g. `helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' })`

// Use `helmet.hidePoweredBy()``

app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy());
```

Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express. `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every request coming from Express by default. The `helmet.hidePoweredBy()` middleware will remove the X-Powered-By header.

---

## Mitigate the Risk of Clickjacking with helmet.frameguard()

```JavaScript
/** 3) Mitigate the risk of clickjacking - `helmet.frameguard()` */

// Your page could be put in a <frame> or <iframe> without your consent.
// This can result in [clickjacking attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking),
// among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into
// interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is. Often this
// happens using another page put over the framed original, in a transparent layer.
// The `X-Frame-Options` header set by this middleware restricts who can put
// your site in a frame. It has three modes: DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM.

// We don't need our app to be framed, so you should use `helmet.frameguard()`
// passing to it the configuration object `{action: 'deny'}`

app.use(helmet.frameguard({ action: 'deny' }));
```

Your page could be put in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>` without your consent; this can result in clickjacking attacks among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is.

We don't need our app to be framed, so you should use `helmet.frameguard()` passing it to the configuration object `{action: 'deny'}` .

## Mitigate the Risk of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks with helmet.xssFilter()

```JavaScript
/** 4) Mitigate the risk of XSS - `helmet.xssFilter()` */

// Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a very frequent type of attack where malicious
// script are injected into vulnerable pages, on the purpous of stealing sensitive
// data like session cookies, or passwords. The basic rule to lower the risk
// of an XSS attack is simple: **"Never trust user's input"**, so as a developer
// you should always *sanitize* all the input coming from the outside.
// This includes data coming from forms, GET query urls, and even from
// POST bodies. Sanitizing means that you should find and encode the characters
// that may be dangerous e.g. `<`, `>`.
// More Info [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet).

// Modern browsers can help mitigating XSS risk by adoptiong software strategies,
// which often are configurable via http headers.
// The `X-XSS-Protection` HTTP header is a basic protection.  When the browser
// detects a potential injected script using an heuristic filter,
// it changes it, making the script not executable.
// It still has limited support.

// Use `helmet.xssFilter()`

app.use(helmet.xssFilter());
```

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a frequent type of attack where malicious scripts are injected into vulnerable pages, with the purpose of stealing sensitive data like session cookies, or passwords.

This is something I learned while working with PHP and forms. It is important to not trust a user's input and sanitize all the input coming from the outside (this includes data from forms, GET query urls, and even from POST bodies).

Modern browsers can help mitigate XSS risk by adopting software strategies; often these are configurable via http headers.

The `helmet.xssFilter()` middleware sets the `X-XSS-Protection` header to prevent reflected XSS attacks.

## Avoid Inferring the Response MIME Type with helmet.noSniff()

```JavaScript
/** 5) Avoid inferring the response MIME type - `helmet.noSniff()` */

// Browsers can use content or MIME sniffing to override response `Content-Type`
// headers to guess and process the data using an implicit content type.
// While this can be convenient in some scenarios, it can also lead to
// some dangerous attacks.
// This middleware sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to `nosniff`,
// instructing the browser to not bypass the provided `Content-Type`.

// Use `helmet.noSniff()`

app.use(helmet.noSniff());
```

Browsers can use content or MIME sniffing to adapt to different datatypes coming from a response. When browsers override the Content-Type headers to guess and process the data, it can potentially lead to some dangerous attacks.

The `(helmet.noSniff())` middleware sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` ; which instructs the browser to not bypass the provided content-type.

---

## Prevent IE from Opening Untrusted HTML with helmet.ieNoOpen()

```JavaScript
/** 6) Prevent IE from opening *untrusted* HTML - `helmet.ieNoOpen()` */

// Some web applications will serve untrusted HTML for download. By default,
// some versions of Internet Explorer will allow you to open those HTML files
// in the context of your site, which means that an untrusted HTML page could
// start doing bad things inside your pages.
// This middleware sets the `X-Download-Options` header to `noopen`,
// to prevent IE users from executing downloads in the *trusted* site's context.

// Use `helmet.ieNoOpen()`

app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen());
```

Some web applications will serve untrusted HTML files for download. For example, you could allow users to upload and download HTML files.

Older versions of Internet Explorer will allow you to open those HTML files in context of your site, which means that an untrusted HTML page could start doing bad things inside your pages.

This middleware sets the `X-Download-Options` to prevent Internet Explorer from executing downloads in your site's context.

---

## Ask Browsers to Access Your Site via HTTPS Only with helmet.hsts()

```JavaScript
/**  7) Ask browsers to access your site via HTTPS only - `helmet.hsts()` */

// HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which 
// helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.
// If your website can be accessed via HTTPS you can ask user's browsers
// to avoid using insecure HTTP. Setting the header `Strict-Transport-Security`
// you instruct  browsers to use HTTPS for all the future requests occurring in a
// specified amount of time. This will work for the requests coming **after**
// the initial request.

// Configure `helmet.hsts()` to instruct browsers to use HTTPS for the next
// **90 days**, passing the config object {maxAge: timeInMilliseconds}. 
// HyperDev already has **hsts** enabled, to override its settings you need to 
// set the field `force` to `true` in the config object. To not alter hyperdev security 
// policy we will intercept and restore the header, after inspecting it for testing.

const ninetyDaysInMilliseconds = 90*24*60*60*1000;
app.use(helmet.hsts({ maxAge: ninetyDaysInMilliseconds, force: true }));

//**Note**:
// Configuring HTTPS on a custom website requires the acquisition of a domain,
// and a SSL/TSL Certificate.
```

This sets the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to keep your users on HTTPS. If your site can be accessed via HTTPS you can ask the user's browser to avoid using insecure HTTP and instead use HTTPS for all the future requests occurring in a specified amount of time.

## Disable DNS Prefetching with helmet.dnsPrefetchControl()

```JavaScript
/** 8) Disable DNS Prefetching - `helmet.dnsPrefetchControl()` */

// To improve performance, most browsers prefetch DNS records for the links in
// a page. In that way the destination ip is already known when the user clicks on a link.
// This may lead to over-use of the DNS service (if you own a big website,
// visited by millions people...), privacy issues (one eavesdropper could infer
// that you are on a certain page - even if encrypted -, from the links you are
// prefecthing), or page statistics alteration (some links may appear visited
// even if they are not). If you have high security needs you can disable
// DNS prefetching, at the cost of a performance penalty.

// Use `helmet.dnsPrefetchControl()`

app.use(helmet.dnsPrefetchControl());
```

This middleware lets you disable browsers' DNS prefetching by setting the `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` header.

Most browsers prefetch DNS records for the links in a page in order to help improve performance. Disabling prefetch can be improve security for users and help relieve stress for DNS services.

After a small amount of research I feel like this is something that really is not a huge issue unless you start running into DNS server performance issues, or user security issues. However, I feel this is something that requires further research.

## Disable Client-Side Caching with helmet.noCache()

```JavaScript
/** 9) Disable Client-Side Caching - `helmet.noCache()` */

// If you are releasing an update for your website, and you want your users
// to download the newer, more performant and safer version, you can (try to)
// disable caching on client's browser, for your website. It can be useful
// in development too. Caching has performance benefits, and you will lose them,
// use this option only when there is a real need.

// Use helmet.noCache()

app.use(helmet.noCache());
```

The `nocache` middleware aims to disable browser caching by setting several headers.

Simply, this can be used when you want users to receive updated versions of your website's files, rather than sticking with cached/older files.

---

## Set a Content Security Policy with helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()

```JavaScript
/** 10) Content Security Policy - `helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()` */

// This challenge highlights one promising new defense that can significantly reduce
// the risk and impact of many type of attacks in modern browsers. By setting and
// configuring a Content Security Policy you can prevent the injection of anything
// unintended  into your page. This will protect your app from XSS vulnerabilities,
// undesidered tracking, malicious frames, and much more.
// CSP works by defining  a whitelist of content sources which are trusted, for
// each kind of resource a web page may need to load (scripts, stylesheets,
// fonts, frames,media,  and so on...). There are multiple directives available,
// so a website owner can have a granular control.
// See http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/ ,
// https://www.keycdn.com/support/content-security-policy/ for more details.
// Unfortunately CSP in unsupported by older browser.
//
// By default, directives are wide open, so it's important to set the `defaultSrc`
// directive (helmet supports both `defaultSrc` and `default-src` naming styles),
// as a fallback for most of the other unspecified directives.
// In this exercise, use `helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()`, and configure it
// setting the `defaultSrc` directive to `["'self'"]` (the list of allowed sources
// must be in an array), in order to trust **only your website address** by default.
// Set also the `scriptSrc` directive so that you will allow scripts to be downloaded
// from your website, and from the domain `trusted-cdn.com`.
//
// **Hint**: 
// in the `"'self'"` keyword, the single quotes are part of the keyword itself, 
// so it needs to be enclosed in **double quotes** to be working.

app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", 'trusted-cdn.com'],
  }
}));
```

The Content Security Policy (CSP) module sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header which can help protect against malicious injection of JavaScript, CSS, plugins, and more.

CSP works by defining a whitelist of content sources which are trusted, for each kind of resource a web page may need to load. There are multiple directives available.

Some useful sites about this subject:
- https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/csp/
- https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/
- https://www.keycdn.com/support/content-security-policy/

## Configure Helmet Using the ‘parent’ helmet() Middleware

The use of `app.use(helmet())` will automatically include much of the middleware presented throughout these lessons about HelmetJS; except `noCache()` and `contentSecurityPolicy()`.

You can disable or set other middleware individually using a configuration object, rather than setting each one as its own `app.use(...)`, for example:

```JavaScript
app.use(helmet({
  frameguard: {              // configure
    action: 'deny'
  },
  contentSecurityPolicy: {   // enable and configure
   directives: {
     defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
     styleSrc: ['style.com'],
   }
  },
 dnsPrefetchControl: false   // disable
}));
```

## Understand BCrypt Hashes

This section starts off by forking a BCrypt boilerplate, so none of the above lessons are part of these next few lessons. Not sure why this was done like this, probably because there are a only three sections that involve BCrypt.

**You can view this project and project files: [On Glitch!](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-squibs-bcrypt?path=server.js)**

**I have created a backup of the project files: [Here](./fcc-squibs-bcrypt/)**

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const express     = require('express');
const bodyParser  = require('body-parser');
const fccTesting  = require('./freeCodeCamp/fcctesting.js');
const app         = express();

fccTesting(app); //For FCC testing purposes

const saltRounds = 12;
const myPlaintextPassword = 'sUperpassw0rd!';
const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'pass123';

// require bcrypt
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
```

This lesson is just used to install BCrypt and set it as a dependency.

BCrypt hashes are very secure. A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data... always unique. This is accomplished through the use of running the original data through an algorithm and having returned a fixed length result. You can make this even more secure by *salting* your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process, which makes it even harder to crack the hash.

BCrypt will always look like: `$2a$13$ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm` .

The first small bit of data `$2a` is defining what kind of hash algorithm was used. The next portion `$13` defines the *cost*. Cost is about h ow much power it takes to compute the hash. It is on a logarithmic scale of 2<sup>cost</sup> and determines how many times the data is put through the hashing algorithm. For example, at a cost of 10 you are able to hash 10 passwords a second on an average computer, however at the cost of 15 it takes 3 seconds per hash; at a cost of 31 it would take multiple days to complete a hash. A cost of 12 is considered very secure at this time.

The last part of the hash `$ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm`, looks like one large string of numbers, periods, and letters, but it is actually 2 separate pieces of information. The first 22 characters is the salt in plain text, and the rest is the hashed password.

## Hash and Compare Passwords Asynchronously

```JavaScript
//START_ASYNC -do not remove notes, place code between correct pair of notes.

bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
  console.log(hash); //$2a$12$Y.PHPE15wR25qrrtgGkiYe2sXo98cjuMCG1YwSI5rJW1DSJp0gEYS
  bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, (err, res) => {
      console.log(res); //true
  });
});

//END_ASYNC
```

As hashing is designed to be computationally intensive, it is recommended to do so **asynchronously** on your server as to avoid blocking any incoming connections while you hash. In order to do this you call: 

```JavaScript
bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => { /* Store hash in your db */ });
```

When you need to figure out if a new input is the same data as the hash you would just use the compare function:

```JavaScript
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, (err, res) => /* res == true or false */ });
```

---

## Hash and Compare Passwords Synchronously

```JavaScript
//START_SYNC

const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);
const result = bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash);

//END_SYNC
```

If you wish to **synchronously** hash you can call (however doing so can cause lag if using it server side with a high cost or with hashing done very often):

```JavaScript
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);
```

You can then compare the password input with the new sync hash:

```JavaScript
var result = bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash);
```

## Introduction to the React and Redux Challenges
This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React.

Here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology:

- React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way.
- Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the managment of your application's state.
- Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app.
- Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role.
- You then dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.

Although React components can manage their own state locally, when you ahve a complex app, it is generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specifc only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, you need to use the ```react-redux``` package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux ```state``` and ```dispatch``` to your React components as ```props```.

---

## Getting Started with React Redux
```JavaScript
class DisplayMessages extends React.Component {
  // change code below this line
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: [],
    };
  }

  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return <div/>
  }
};
```

Over the next few challenges, first, you'll create a simple React component which allows you to input new text messages. These are added to an array that is displaye din the view. This shoulda be a nice review of what you learned in the React lessons. 

Next, you will create a Redux store and actions that manage the stae of the messages array.

Finally, you will use ```react-redux``` to connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.

---

## Manage State Locally First
```JavaScript
class DisplayMessages extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
  }

  // add handleChange() and submitMessage() methods here
  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ input: event.target.value });
  }

  submitMessage = () => {
    this.setState({
      input: '',
      messages: this.state.messages.concat(this.state.input),
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        { /* render an input, button, and ul here */ }
        
        <input onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.input}/>
        
        <br/>

        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map((message, index) => {
            return (<li key={index}>{message}</li>)
          })}
        </ul>
        
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

I was not able to do a lot of this from memory. I have a lot of work ahead of me in order to get more comfortable with working with React (and Redux).

## Extract State Logic to Redux
```JavaScript
// define ADD, addMessage(), messageReducer(), and store here:
const ADD = 'ADD';

// action creator (action in messageReducer())
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return { type: ADD, message }
};

// reducer
const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return [...state, action.message];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// store
const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);
```

---

## Use Provider to Connect Redux to React
```JavaScript
// Redux Code:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state.concat(action.message);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React Code:
class DisplayMessages extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }

  submitMessage = () => {
    const currentMessage = this.state.input;
    this.setState({
      input: '',
      messages: this.state.messages.concat(currentMessage)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/>
        <br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  // render the Provider here

  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <DisplayMessages/>
      </Provider>
    );
  }

  // change code above this line
};
```

React Redux provides its ```react-redux``` package to help provide React access to the Redux store and the actions it needs to dispatch updates.

React Redux provides a small API with two key features: ```Provider``` and ```connect```. Another challenge will cover ```connect```.

The ```Provider```  is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux ```store``` and ```dispatch``` functions throughout your component tree. ```Provider``` takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the ```Provider``` for an App component might look like this:

```HTML
<Provider store={store}>
  <App/>
</Provider>
```

---

## Map State to Props
```JavaScript
const state = [];

// change code below this line
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ messages: state });
```

The ```Provider``` component allows you to provide ```state``` and ```dispatch``` to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want. This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs.

You accomplish this by creating two functions: ```mapStateToProps()``` and ```mapDispatchToProps()```. In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and what action creators you need to be able to dispatch.

<b>Note:</b> Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the ```store.subscribe()``` method to implement ```mapStateToProps()```.

---

## Map Dispatch to Props
```JavaScript
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

// change code below this line
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({ submitNewMessage: (message) => dispatch(addMessage(message)) });
```

The ```mapDispatchToProps()``` function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It is similar to the ```mapStateToProps()``` function. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component ```props```. However, instead of returning a piece of ```state```, each property returns a functon that calls ```dispatch``` with an action creator and any relevant action data.

You have access to this ```dispatch``` because it is passed to ```mapDispatchToProps()``` as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passsed ```state``` to ```mapStateToProps()```.

Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's ```store.dispatch()``` to conduct these dispatches with ```mapDispatchToProps()```. This is similar to how it uses ```store.subscribe()``` for components that are mapped to ```state```.

For example, you have a ```loginUser()``` action creator that takes a ```username``` as an action payload. The oabject returned from ```mapDispatchToProps()``` for this acton creator would look something like:

```JavaScript
{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}
```

---

## Connect Redux to React
```JavaScript
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    messages: state
  }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (message) => {
      dispatch(addMessage(message));
    }
  }
};

class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return <h3>This is a Presentational Component</h3>
  }
};

const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// change code below this line
const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);
```

The ```connect``` method from React Redux can map ```state``` and ```dispatch``` to the ```props``` of one of your React components. The ```connect``` method takes two optional arguments, ```mapStateToProps()``` and ```mapDispatchToProps()```. They are optional because you may have a compnent that only needs access to ```state``` but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.

To use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. This syntax is alittle unusual and looks like:

```connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)```

<b>Note:</b> If you want to omit one of the arguments to the ```connect``` method, you pass ```null``` in its place.

## Connect Redux to the Messages App
```JavaScript
// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message: message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state.concat(action.message);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:
class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }

  submitMessage = () => {
    const currentMessage = this.state.input;
    this.setState({
      input: '',
      messages: this.state.messages.concat(currentMessage)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/>
        <br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

// React-Redux:
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return { messages: state }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (newMessage) => {
        dispatch(addMessage(newMessage))
    }
  }
};

const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// define the Container component here:
const Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    // complete the return statement:
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Container/>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
};
```

---

## Extract Local State into Redux
```JavaScript
// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message: message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state.concat(action.message);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:
const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// Change code below this line
class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
    }
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }

  submitMessage = () => {
    this.props.submitNewMessage(this.state.input);
    
    this.setState({
      input: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/>
        <br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.props.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
// Change code above this line

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {messages: state}
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (message) => {
      dispatch(addMessage(message))
    }
  }
};

const Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Container/>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
};
```

Now that Redux is connected to the messages app, you need to extract teh state management out of the ```Presentational``` component and into Redux. The state is currently being handled locally within the ```Presentational``` component, when you want state to be handled by Redux.

## Moving Forward From Here
```JavaScript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

import rootReducer from './redux/reducers'
import App from './components/App'

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App/>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// change code below this line
console.log('Now I know React and Redux!'); // kinda
```

Typically, you won't write React apps in a code eidtor like this. This challenge gives a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you are working with npm and a file system on your own machine. The code should look similar, except for the use of ```import``` statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges).

Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration. This can get complicated quickly. If you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) comes configured and ready to go.

Alternatively, you can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.

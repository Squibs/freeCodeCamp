jQuery playground 

Keywords: jQuery,

jQuery is the most popular JavaScript tool of all time.
All jQuery is done outside of html; in the head.
code put inside a document.ready function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
	without the document ready function the code may run before your html is rendered which could cause bugs
All jQuery functions start with $ (dollar sign operator, bling)
$("STRING") is a selector; .addClass("animated bounce"); is adding a css class to the selected
	animated and bounce are both different classes in jQuery's library
		eg($("STRING").addClass("animated bounce");) 
	several targets include:
		$("button") select by type
		$(".btn") select by class
		$("#target1") select by ID
	several jQuery functions are
		.addClass(); add a class to the target
		.removeClass(); remove a class from the target
		.css(); edit CSS of the target
			eg ( .css("background-color", "blue"); )
		.prop(); edit the properties of the target]
		.html(); add HTML tags and text within an element
		.text(); alters text only; won't evaluate html tags passed to it
		.remove(); removes element
		.appendTo(); move element to another element
		.clone(); clones element
		.parent(); access parent of element that is selected
			eg ( $("#target1").parent().css("background-color", "red"); )
		.children(); access child of element that is selected
	function chaining allows you to combine jQuery functions 
		eg( $("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well"); )
	jQuery can use CSS Selectors to target elements
		eg( target:nth-child(n) )
			eg ( $(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bunce"); )
		.target:odd selects odd-numbered elements
			jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second, fourth and so on elements.
		.target:even selects even-numbered elements

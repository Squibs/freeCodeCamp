## Introduction to the Redux Challenges
Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for th entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object hosued in the Redux ```store```. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

This also means that any time any peice of your app wants to update state, it <b>must</b> do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state managament in your app.

---

## Create a Redux Store
```JavaScript
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
// Define the store here:

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```

The Redux ```store``` is an object which holds and manages application ```state```. There is a method called ```createStore()``` on the Redux object; this method takes a ```reducer``` function as a required argument. 

---

## Get the State of the Redux Store
```JavaScript
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// change code below this line
console.log(store.getState()); // outputs 5
```

You can retrieve the current ```state``` held in the Redux store object with the ```getState()``` method.

---

## Define a Redux Action
```JavaScript
// Define an action here:
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
```

Updating state is one of Redux's core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred.

The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. A Redux action can even carry some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is optional, actions must carry a ```type``` property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.

Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

---

## Define an Action Creator
```JavaScript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:
const actionCreator = () => action;
```

You define action creators in Redux to send the action to the Redux store. An action creator is a JavaScript function that returns an action.

In other words, action creators create objects that represent action events.

Provided solution:
```JavaScript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:
const actionCreator = () => {
  return action;
};
```

---

## Dispatch an Action Event
```JavaScript
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = {login: false}) => state
);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

// Dispatch the action here:
// store.dispatch(loginAction());
store.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });
```

The ```store.dispatch()``` method is what you use to dispatch actions to the Redux store. Calling ```store.dispatch()``` and passing the value returned from an action creator sends an action back to the store.

Action creators return an object with a type property that specifies the action that has occured; then the method dispatches an action object to the Redux store. Knowing this, the following lines are equivalent, and both dispatch the action of type ```LOGIN```:

```store.dispatch(actionCreator());```

```store.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });```

---

## Handle an Action in the Store
```JavaScript
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line

  return action.type === 'LOGIN' ? { login: true } : state;

  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
```

After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a ```reducer``` function.

A ```reducer``` takes ```state``` and ```action``` as arguments, and it always returns a new ```state```. This is the <b>only role</b> of the reducer.

Another key principle n Redux is taht ```state``` is read-only. A ```reducer``` function must <b>always</b> return a new copy of ```state``` and never modify state directly.

Redux does not enfore state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions.

---

## Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions
```JavaScript
const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return { authenticated: true };
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return { authenticated: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }

  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGOUT'
  }
};
```

You can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. Say you are managing user authenticaton in your Redux store. You want to have a state representatoin for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. You represent this with a single state object with the property ```authenticated```. You also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.

---

## Use const for Action Types
```JavaScript
// change code below this line

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

// change code above this line

const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {

    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }

    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGIN
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGOUT
  }
};
```

It is common practice to assign action types as read-only constants, then reference these constants whenever they are used.

This is the same as the last challenge only now instead of using strings in the action creators and the ```authReducer()``` it is now using ```const``` declared variables, so they cannot be changed.

---

## Register a Store Listener
```JavaScript
const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

// change code below this line

store.subscribe(() => console.log(`Received an acton, state updated: ${store.getState()}`));

// change code above this line

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
```

Another method in the Redux ```store``` object is ```store.subscribe()```. This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenver an action is dispatched against the store.

One simple method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.

---

## Combine Multiple Reducers
```JavaScript
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// define the root reducer here
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  count: counterReducer,
  auth: authReducer,
});

const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);
```

The first principle of Redux is that all app state is held in a single state object in the store. Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux ```createStore()``` method.

Redux has a ```combineReducers()``` method which accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.

Typically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, in a note-taking app with the user authentication, one reducer could handle authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is submitting. For such an application, we might write the ```combineReducers()``` method like this:

```JavaScript
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  auth: authenticationReducer,
  notes: notesReducer,
});
```

Now, the key ```notes``` wil contain all of the state associated with our notes and handled by our ```notesReducer```.

THis is how multiple reducers can be composed to manage more complex  applicaiton state. In this example, the state held in the Redux store would then be a single object containing ```auth``` and ```notes``` properties.

---

## Send Action Data to the Store
```JavaScript
const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';

const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    // change code below this line
      
    case ADD_NOTE:
      return action.text;

    // change code above this line
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addNoteText = (note) => {
  // change code below this line

  return {
    type: ADD_NOTE,
    text: note,
  };

  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);

console.log(store.getState());
store.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));
console.log(store.getState());
```

As stated previously, data can also be sent along with actions. This is very common because actions usualy originate from some user interaction and tend to carry some data with them. The Redux store often needs to know abut this data.

---

## Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions
```JavaScript
const REQUESTING_DATA = 'REQUESTING_DATA'
const RECEIVED_DATA = 'RECEIVED_DATA'

const requestingData = () => { return {type: REQUESTING_DATA} }
const receivedData = (data) => { return {type: RECEIVED_DATA, users: data.users} }

const handleAsync = () => {
  return function(dispatch) {
    // dispatch request action here
    dispatch(requestingData());

    setTimeout(function() {
      let data = {
        users: ['Jeff', 'William', 'Alice']
      }
      // dispatch received data action here
      dispatch(receivedData(data));
      
    }, 2500);
  }
};

const defaultState = {
  fetching: false,
  users: []
};

const asyncDataReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case REQUESTING_DATA:
      return {
        fetching: true,
        users: []
      }
    case RECEIVED_DATA:
      return {
        fetching: false,
        users: action.users
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(
  asyncDataReducer,
  Redux.applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk.default)
);
```

So far these challenges have avoided discussing asynchronous actions, but they are an unavoidable part of web development. At some point you will need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app. Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose, called Redux Thunk middleware.

To include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to ```Redux.applyMiddleWare()```. This statement is then provided as a second optional parameter to the ```createStore()``` function. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in the acton creator that takes ```dispatch``` as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests.

The asynchronous request is simulated in this example with a ```setTimeout()``` call. It is common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data, you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with the information that the action is completed.

Remember that you are passing ```dispatch``` as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care of the rest.

---

## Write a Counter in Redux
```JavaScript
// define a constant for increment action types
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
// define a constant for decrement action types
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

// define the counter reducer which will increment or decrement the state based on the action it receives
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// define an action creator for incrementing
const incAction = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });

// define an action creator for decrementing
const decAction = () => ({ type: DECREMENT });

// define the Redux store here, passing in your reducers
const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);
```

I learned that to return an object literal while using ES6 arrow functions, the object must be wrapped in parenthheses; I guess I never ran into a situation where I needed to return an object in this way. This is going to be a good thing to know for Redux, I believe.

---

## Never Mutate State
```JavaScript
const ADD_TO_DO = 'ADD_TO_DO';

const immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD_TO_DO:
      return state.concat(action.todo); // don't mutate state here

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addToDo = (todo) => {
  return {
    type: ADD_TO_DO,
    todo
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

If you took a snapshot of the state of a Redux app over time, you would see something like ```state 1```, ```state 2```, ```state 3```, ```state 4```, ```...```, and so on where each state may be similar to the last, but each is a distinct piece of data. This immutability, in fact, iws what provides such features as time-travel debugging.

Redux, as stated before, does not enforce state immutability. Fortunately, JavaScript (especially ES6), provides several useful tools that can be used to enforce the immutability of your state, whether it is a ```string```, ```number```, ```array```, or ```object```. Strings and numbers are primitive values and are immutable by nature. In other words, 3 is always 3. You cannot change the value of the number 3. An ```array``` or ```object``` are mutable. Your state, in practice, will probably consist of an ```array``` or ```object```, as these are useful data structures for representing many types of information.

---

## Use the Spread Operator on Arrays
```JavaScript
const immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_DO':
      const newState = [...state];
      return newState.concat(action.todo); // don't mutate state here
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addToDo = (todo) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',
    todo
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

or instead of using the ```concat()``` array method:

```JavaScript
case 'ADD_TO_DO':
  const newState = [...state, action.todo];
  return newState; // don't mutate state here
```

finally you can shorten this even more to:

```JavaScript
case 'ADD_TO_DO':
  return [...state, action.todo]; // don't mutate state here
```

---

## Remove an Item from an Array
```JavaScript
const immutableReducer = (state = [0,1,2,3,4,5], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return [...state.slice(0, action.index), ...state.slice(action.index + 1)]; // don't mutate state here
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const removeItem = (index) => {
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
    index
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

```[...state.slice(0, action.index), ...state.slice(action.index + 1)]```

```[...state.slice(0, action.index),``` - fills the array up to before the array index to be removed

```...state.slice(action.index+1)]``` - fills the rest of the array with the remaining values after the index to be removed

---

## Copy an Object with Object.assign
```JavaScript
const ONLINE = 'ONLINE';

const defaultState = {
  user: 'CamperBot',
  status: 'offline',
  friends: '732,982',
  community: 'Free Code Camp'
};

const immutableReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ONLINE:
      return Object.assign({}, state, { status: 'online' }); // don't mutate state here
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const wakeUp = () => {
  return {
    type: ONLINE
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

```Object.assign()``` takes a target object and source objects and maps properties from the source objects to the target object. Any matching propeties are overwritten by properties in the source objects.

This behavior is commonly used to make shallow copies of objects by passing an empty object as the first argument followed by the object(s) you want to copy. For example:

```const newObject = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);```

This creates ```newObject``` as a new ```object```, which contains the properties that currently exist in ```obj1``` and ```obj2```.

---

## Use the ES6 Spread Operator with Objects
```JavaScript
const defaultState = {
  user: 'CamperBot',
  status: 'offline',
  friends: '732,982',
  community: 'Free Code Camp'
};

const immutableReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ONLINE':
      return  { ...state, status: 'online' } // don't mutate state here

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const wakeUp = () => {
  return {
    type: 'ONLINE',
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

There is another syntax that may become standardized in a future verson of JavaScript, which is introduced in this challenge. It is a spread operator that is applied to objects. This is currently a proposed language feature that can be taken advantage of with the Babel transpiler.

The object spread operator allows you to spread out object properties much like when you used the spread operator to spread out array values. For example, you have the following object:

```JavaScript
const user = {
  authenticated: true,
  username: 'Jeff',
}
```

Now if you write the following:

```JavaScript
const updatedUser = {
  ...user,
  authenticated: false,
}
```

The ```updatedUser``` object will equal the following:

```JavaScript
{
  username: 'Jeff',
  authenticated: false,
}
```

You have 'spread' the ```user``` object properties into a new object and then added the new properties. Similar to ```Object.assign()```, properties with matching names are overwritten. The proposed object spread syntax provides a very concise way to return new objects from existing objects, especially if you are interestead in only modifying a few keys.

Note that the ordering of keys in the examples above is not important because JavaScript objects are unordered collections of properties. This syntax is encountered quite often, so it's good to be familiar with it, even if you don't use it yourself.

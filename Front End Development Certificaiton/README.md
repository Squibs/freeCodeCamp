The first basic front end development project introduced. I made a tribute page to John M. Keynes a 20th century British economist. This was the first project that did not give any step-by-step directions and instead let the learner go off of just an example as a end-goal. I used some Bootstrap 4.0.0 alpha classes in this project; mainly a 'Card' for the image, as they removed thumbnails in this version of Bootstrap.

Simple starting project. Many things were changed throughout the creation of this; lines were deleted or replaced multiple times. Teachings of responsive design were made and the basic foundations of html, css, and bootstrap were taught in this lesson/project. (Best viewed at low resolutions)

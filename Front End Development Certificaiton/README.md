The first basic front end development project introduced. I made a tribute page to John M. Keynes a 20th century British economist. This was the first project that did not give any step-by-step directions and instead let the learner go off of just an example as a end-goal. I used some Bootstrap 4.0.0 alpha classes in this project; mainly a 'Card' for the image, as they removed thumbnails in this version of Bootstrap.

A playground used in several freeCodeCamp challenges teaching about how to use various jQuery commands. While this is not very much of a project to show off, I believe it is a good thing to recognize a simple project that allows you to test the many functions of jQuery. View project-notes.txt for notes on various commands that can be used with this.

Simple starting project. Many things were changed throughout the creation of this; lines were deleted or replaced multiple times. Teachings of responsive design were made as well as the basic foundations of html, css, and bootstrap were taught in this lesson/project. This was made to fit the size of a fairly small screen-sized phone. Best viewed at lower resolutions; all content scales with size, using the portrait-based editor layout on codepen.io will allow the use of a slider to see how the content reacts when space is lowered.

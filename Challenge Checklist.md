# freeCodeCamp Challenge Checklist

I created this check list as the beta freeCodeCamp website is currently not reliable in tracking progress. The progress will be wiped in the future anyways once the site is pushed live. It is interesting to see how many tasks there are in this way anyhow.

**685** out of **1463** tasks complete.
(*My own challenge count. May or may not be up-to-date.*)

freeCodeCamp lists: 
- **684** of **1651** challenges
- **14** of **70** projects
- **1** of **3** legacy certifications
- **2** of **9** certifications
